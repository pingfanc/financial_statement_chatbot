# Financial statement analysis end-to-end project

This project is trying to create a chatbot for financial statements. The goal is for users to upload the financial statements they are interested in into the chatbot.
Then, the chatbot will be able to respond to any answer related to the financial statements and make a comparison between similar companies. 

To build this chatbot, Langchain and OpenAI are the main packages that I use. For the user interface, it is built with plotly-dash.
