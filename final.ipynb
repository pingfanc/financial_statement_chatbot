Individually and collectively, we have been guided by \\nour purpose to serve our customers, communities and planet \\na little better every day. This united effort, as well as our \\ncollaborative and supportive culture, is one of our biggest \\nadvantages in tough times.\\nSupporting our customers with a relentless  \\nfocus on value\\nInflation is a pressing reality for everyone – customers, \\ncolleagues, suppliers, and every member of our communities. \\nAt Tesco, we know it is our job to listen, to understand and then \\nto act to help customers through these challenges. We also know \\ncustomers are looking for value but do not want to compromise \\non the other aspects of their shop that are important to them. \\nThis is why we are focused on keeping the weekly shop not just \\nreliably affordable, but also healthy and sustainable, while \\ndelivering great quality and convenience. \\nWhen it comes to value, we know that customers are looking for \\nit wherever, whenever and however they choose to shop with us. \\nThis is why we have doubled down on value across the whole \\nGroup, see page 4. \\nWe have price-matched more than 600 every day items to Aldi in \\nthe UK, and locked our Low Everyday Prices on hundreds of \\neveryday staples until Easter in the UK and ROI. We’ve also fully \\nrolled out Clubcard Prices to every market, and launched \\nnew initiatives via Tesco Bank and Tesco Mobile. And, following the \\nlaunch of our cost-of-living hub through Tesco Bank, we can offer guidance and advice to help people manage their finances. Booker \\nhas also been a champion of value, supporting customers with a \\nprice freeze on 450 key catering lines. For further details on all \\nthese initiatives and more, see pages 4-5.\\nRecognising our colleagues\\nOur colleagues are at the heart of everything we do. We recognised \\nthat with household costs rising in the UK, the ROI and Central \\nEurope, we needed to reflect their value in our reward package. \\nColleagues in every market have therefore received substantial \\ninvestments in their base pay. In the UK, this included a nearly 8% \\nincrease for hourly-paid colleagues in 2022.\\nWorking in partnership with suppliers\\nOur partnerships with suppliers have been essential this year \\nas we all worked hard to keep the weekly shop as affordable as \\npossible for customers. We recognise the inflationary pressures \\nthat suppliers are facing and have therefore been committed to \\nworking collaboratively to manage all associated impacts.\\nWe’ve always been clear that where there are pressures, we will \\nplay our part in providing support. For example, we’ve announced \\nadditional support for a number of agricultural sectors including a \\n£27.5m investment in the British egg industry and a 10% increase \\nin contract pricing for the 2022 potato harvest. \\nAs a result, suppliers have voted us the number 1 retailer in \\nthe independently run Advantage survey for seven years \\nrunning, reflecting our commitment to strong partnerships \\nand collaboration.\\nSupporting our local communities\\nHaving a positive impact on the communities we serve is central \\nto our purpose, and it was essential that we stepped up for them \\nwhen they most needed our support. We did this through our £1m \\nGolden Grant programme, offering a £10,000 grant to 100 local \\ncharities chosen by customers. We also introduced Kids Eat Free \\nat Tesco Cafés during school holidays, giving away nearly 440,000 \\nmeals to children.\\n8 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023', metadata={'source': 'pdf files/tesco.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",

Tesco is the biggest \\nsupplier of food distributed by FareShare, and alongside our \\ncustomers we are also the largest single source of food donations \\nfor food banks for The Trussell Trust. I have been bowled over \\nthis year by the continued generosity of Tesco colleagues and \\ncustomers in all our markets.\\nLooking after the planet\\nWhile we focused on the rising cost of living during the year, we \\nwere acutely aware that we could not put the environment on \\nhold. We needed to press ahead with urgency on reducing our \\nimpact on the planet and we did just that. The relentless efforts \\nof our teams towards our net zero commitment have helped us \\nachieve a 55% reduction in emissions in our own operations \\nsince our 2015 baseline. \\nWe also became the first UK retailer to ban plastic wet wipes \\nand, in addition, we have removed two billion pieces of plastic \\nfrom the UK business to date. In the UK, by summer 2023, all \\nTesco tea bags will be compostable – that amounts to more \\nthan one billion bags a year. \\nWe are working closely with our farmers and suppliers to promote \\nbiodiversity in farming practices. We were particularly pleased this \\nyear to launch a large-scale commercial field trial with five major \\nfresh produce suppliers to identify the most planet-friendly and \\ncost-effective alternatives to conventional fertilisers. This trial will \\nhelp reduce reliance on chemical fertilisers as well as reducing \\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the supply chain. \\nWe continue to roll out electric vans for customer deliveries, and \\nour fleet has now grown to include nearly 300 vans. We also now \\nprovide 2,500 customer electric vehicle (EV) charging points \\nacross 600 stores, as we seek to minimise our own emissions \\nwhile working towards our overarching goal of net zero by 2050. \\nThis remains an ongoing journey, and one where we need to work \\nclosely with our suppliers and the industry. \\nProgress on our strategic priorities\\nI am delighted with the progress we have made since launching \\nour strategic priorities and performance framework last year. \\nAs we have responded to the various challenges involved, our \\npriorities have only become more relevant as we build on our \\nunique strengths and focus on doing the basics brilliantly.\\nWe dig into the details of our strategic priorities on pages 12 and \\n13, but I do want to say a few words on Clubcard. Since launching \\nClubcard Prices in all our markets, we have had a great response \\nfrom customers. The number of active Clubcard holders we have \\nin Central Europe has trebled this year, with sales penetration \\nreaching 83%. Penetration in the ROI has risen to nearly 77% \\nthis year, while we are at nearly 79% in the UK. We are on a \\njourney to make Clubcard more personalised, and have rolled \\nout individualised digital coupons to four million customers in \\nthe UK alone. \\nOur data science business, dunnhumby, is helping us to access \\nnew revenue streams from Clubcard. Since launching the Tesco \\nMedia and Insight platform with dunnhumby last year, we have \\nhelped 450 leading brands increase the effectiveness of their \\ncampaigns, build more interactive, two-way relationships with \\ncustomers, and grow loyalty for Tesco and our suppliers.Reduced in price. Just as nice.\\nTo help our customers find bargains more easily and \\nsupport our commitment to providing customers with \\ngreat value, we launched our ‘Reduced in price. Just as \\nnice.’ areas in over 100 stores. These reduced-to-clear \\nsections feature a wide range of products at lower prices, \\nincluding fresh produce like salads, meat, bread and sweet \\ntreats that are close to their expiry date. They not only \\nhelp customers find something tasty for dinner, or to pop \\nin the freezer, at a lower price - they also contribute to \\nour goal of halving food waste by 2025.\\nVisit www.tescoplc.com/news/2022/reduced-to-\\nclear-signage-revampDelivering for shareholders\\nFor shareholders, we have delivered another year of strong \\ngrowth. Regardless of the external challenges, we have remained \\nfocused on our strategic priorities and have been guided by our \\npurpose at all times.\\nWhile there is significant uncertainty in the year ahead, we have \\nconfidence in our ability to continue to generate cash in the \\ncoming years, and we are committed to a progressive dividend \\npolicy, this year announcing a full-year dividend of 10.90p per share.\\nWe are building good momentum and have strong plans in place \\nthat will make the most of our unique strengths.

       " Document(page_content='Group Chief Executive’s review continued\\nQ&A  \\nwith Ken.\\nWhat is your highlight from this year? \\nMy highlight is the time I have spent in stores, when I’m able to talk \\nto colleagues and customers and see some of the team’s great work \\ncome to life. It’s also a chance to get some honest feedback about \\nwhat is working and what isn’t. Retail is a fast-moving industry, and \\nyou learn so much from being on the shop floor. There’s never a \\nbetter time to be in stores than at Christmas. I travelled around \\nvarious stores in the Christmas week and the atmosphere was \\nfantastic – I loved every minute.\\nHow has Tesco responded to the cost-of-living \\nchallenges faced by colleagues this year?\\nIt has been really important to recognise that colleagues have \\nfaced rising household bills just as much as customers. Of course, \\nwe have invested in pay, see page 16 for details. But we’ve also \\nmade a number of smaller changes that colleagues say have made a \\nhuge difference. These range from doubling our Colleague Clubcard \\ndiscount over Christmas, to ensuring colleagues have plenty of \\ngood food available for free in colleague rooms – not to mention \\nintroducing a pay advance for any colleague who might be facing \\nan unexpected bill.\\nHow have you balanced the needs of all \\nstakeholders? \\nThis has been a year when all our stakeholders have faced their own \\nchallenges and balancing those needs has been a delicate task. We \\nalways strive to make sure we’re doing the right thing and that we’re \\naligned to our purpose of serving our customers, communities and \\nplanet a little better every day. All that work helps give stakeholders \\nconfidence in our business, which in turn can create significant \\nvalue for our shareholders. \\nHow has Tesco managed some of the year’s \\nbroader macroeconomic and political instability?\\nIn the same way that we’ve managed the various challenges over \\nthe last three years. We have focused on what we can control. \\nWhere there was expected disruption, we had excellent plans in \\nplace to mitigate that. Where we needed to respond quickly, we \\ndemonstrated just how flexible we can be. In my view, that mixture \\nof resilience and flexibility is a great strength of Tesco. \\nHas Tesco had to press pause on any \\nsustainability initiatives as it focused on serving \\ncustomers through the cost-of-living pressures?\\nNo, and that’s been really important. While the external focus may \\nhave been on value and prices, it was essential that we didn’t drop \\nthe ball on sustainability. In fact, we took our plans even further. \\nNow is a critical time to take action on climate change, and we’re \\ndoing that by driving improvements and innovation at every point \\nin our value chain. That’s first in our own operations, then in our \\nsupply chain and for our customers. Our plan on climate action \\nfocuses on the areas where we can make the biggest difference \\n– energy, transport, waste, food production and diets. You have talked previously about food \\nsecurity. Is this still a concern?\\nI believe that people haven’t talked about food security enough \\nuntil now. If you look at the droughts in China, the floods in \\nPakistan, the crop failures in Canada and the US last year, you \\nhave to assume that we’re going to see an even greater increase \\nin food insecurity. After energy, the food system has the greatest \\nimpact on the environment. We continue to work closely with our \\nsuppliers to improve food systems around the world and support \\nthem in making more sustainable choices. We have invested \\nsignificantly in UK agricultural supply chains as they face \\nchallenging market conditions, aiming to ensure they’re \\nsustainable in the long term. We continue to work on tackling \\ndeforestation in Brazil. During COP27, we joined forces with \\n40 UK food companies and soy suppliers in announcing a landmark \\nset of actions to ensure all soy used in animal feed in the UK is \\ndeforestation-free. These commitments will help us to deliver \\nagainst the aims of the UK Soy Manifesto, which was agreed by \\nthe industry at COP26 in Glasgow.\\nWhat progress have you made towards your \\nhealth targets?\\nEating a well-balanced, healthy, sustainable diet is one of the best \\nways we can look after our health and the health of the planet \\n– and we want to make it easier than ever for our customers to \\ndo this. We launched our Better Baskets campaign to help to \\nmake Tesco the easiest place to shop for affordable, healthy, \\nsustainable food. This year we’ve driven an improvement in our \\nhealth scores, from 58% to 60% in the UK & ROI and maintained \\nthe baseline position of 49% in Central Europe. We’ve removed \\nmore than 71 billion calories since 2018 through reformulation. \\nWe continue to look for ways to support customers and remove \\nbarriers to healthier eating, such as the Kids Eat Free offer in our \\ncafés that helps children access a nutritionally balanced meal \\noutside term time.\\nWhat are the key priorities for the \\nyear ahead? \\nI’m excited about the momentum we are building. We have a \\nformula that’s working and that we can build on and accelerate. \\nFor me, it’s about really making progress against those key \\nstrategic priorities. There’s plenty of exciting innovation in \\nthe pipeline – in product development, channels and \\ncustomer experience. \\nWhat is your outlook for the year ahead?\\nAs we build on our momentum over the coming year, we believe \\nthat it’s as important as ever to remain focused on investing in \\nour customers and delivering them the great value and quality \\nthey expect when shopping.\\n10 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023', metadata={'source': 'pdf files/tesco.pdf', 'page': 11}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Our market context\\nMarket drivers How we are responding\\nConcerns over cost of living\\nThe rise in household costs means that more than ever \\nbefore, customers are looking for affordable solutions while \\nmaintaining their standard of living. Customers are more \\nselective and deliberate on what they spend their money on, \\nlooking for ways to make their food budget go further. For us, that makes it essential to deliver the best quality at the best \\nprice. Our value proposition of Low Everyday Prices combined with \\nexceptional value offered by Clubcard Prices and Aldi Price Match \\nmeans we are at the most competitive position we have been in for \\nmany years. As customers look for the best value, we offer that right \\nacross the store – from the volume-driven success of our Price Lock \\ncampaign through to the growth of our Finest range. For some \\ncustomers, it is trading down from national brands to great value Tesco \\nproducts. For others, it is seeking out Tesco from one of the higher-\\npriced, premium-focused retailers, or using our great range of ready \\nmeals instead of a takeaway or restaurant meal. \\nPlanet protection\\nWith the effects of climate change becoming more pronounced \\nand happening more frequently across the globe, customers \\nwant to take action to reduce their impact on the environment. \\nThey expect responsible businesses to do the same. As a result, \\nmany customers are seeking responsibly sourced, less resource-\\nintensive goods that safeguard the planet.The efforts of our teams towards our net zero commitment have \\nhelped us achieve a 55% reduction in emissions in our own operations \\nagainst a 2015/16 baseline, see more on pages 18 and 19. We became \\nthe first UK retailer to ban plastic wet wipes and, in addition, we have \\nremoved 2 billion pieces of plastic from the UK business to date. We \\nare also taking action to reduce emissions across our supply chains, \\ntrialling agricultural innovations such as low-carbon fertilisers, \\nalternative animal feeds and vertical farming techniques. \\nRecognising diversity\\nAs society is projected to become more diverse, the need \\nfor representation and recognition is growing. Customers \\nare increasingly looking to brands that take pride in – and \\nchampion – differences.As one of the largest employers in the UK, we recognise the importance \\nof representing the communities we serve. Central to achieving this goal \\nis our diversity and inclusion strategy, and the support we give to our \\ncolleagues on their individual career journeys. During the year we \\nlaunched our Black Action Plan and were named among The Times Top \\n50 Employers for Women for the second year running. For more \\ninformation, see our Everyone’s Welcome report at www.tescoplc.com/\\nmedia/759669/tesco-everyones-welcome-report-2022.\\nWe continue to look for ways to promote inclusivity and increase \\nrepresentation for our customers. These include; the launch of a \\nbasics range with skin tone colours, introducing products specifically \\ndesigned for Black hair, and reflecting the diversity of our customers \\nin our advertising.\\nDigital retail\\nRecent years have seen a significant increase in the number \\nof businesses focusing on online, quick, and checkout-free \\ncommerce. Customers have access to shopping whenever, \\nwherever and however they want it. And they continue to expect \\nbetter, faster, integrated digital retail to make shopping easier.One of our strategic priorities is to be Easily the most convenient for \\nour customers. Our extensive store footprint reached a milestone \\nwith the opening of our 2,000th UK Tesco Express store in Cambridge \\nin March. That, combined with more than 1,000 One Stop stores and \\nmore than 7,000 Booker fascias, means we have the largest network of \\nconvenience stores across the UK. This is complemented by the UK’s \\nbiggest online grocery service and exciting new initiatives such as our \\nWhoosh rapid-delivery service and our frictionless GetGo stores.\\nLocal community respect \\nThe effects of the pandemic led to many people spending more \\ntime in their local areas. The continued prevalence of \\nhomeworking has continued this, with a knock-on effect being \\nincreased care for and prioritisation of local environments. Having a positive impact on the communities we serve is central to \\nour purpose. We stepped up for them in the past year through our £1m \\nGolden Grant programme, offering a £10,000 grant to 100 local \\ncharities chosen by customers. We also introduced Kids Eat Free \\nat Tesco Cafés during school holidays, giving away nearly 440,000 \\nmeals to children.

       " Document(page_content='Commitment \\nClimate change remains the biggest and most complex challenge \\nfacing the world, with its impacts felt across our supply chain, \\noperations and the communities we serve. The food sector is \\nresponsible for more than a third of greenhouse gas (GHG) \\nemissions. We are committed to playing a leading role in helping to \\ntackle these emissions and avoid the most severe consequences \\nof climate change. We strengthened our commitment to being \\ncarbon neutral across our Group operations by 2035 and hitting \\nnet zero by 2050 across our full value chain, aligned to 1.5˚C. \\nThese targets act as the overarching goal, recognising that bringing \\nnature and climate together into one holistic environmental \\nstrategy is critical, alongside packaging and food waste, healthy, \\nsustainable diets, sustainable agriculture, and protecting forests. \\nWith these agendas orientated towards our overarching net zero \\ntarget, it allows us to explore new opportunities through their \\ninterconnectivity and ultimately nurture entire ecosystems that \\nare truly sustainable end to end.\\nOur goal to reach net zero needs transformational change in how \\nwe grow, produce and consume food. To achieve this, we are \\ndeveloping detailed, timebound plans to decarbonise key areas of \\nour emissions footprint, particularly the production of our most \\nmaterial agricultural products. \\nRecognising that we cannot achieve our climate ambitions alone, \\nwe continue to promote cross-industry action and advocate to \\nalign public policy with net zero across our markets. We do this \\nthrough our flagship partnership with WWF, as well as our \\nmembership with forums such as the Aldersgate Group and the \\nClimate Group, and involvement in leading industry initiatives such \\nas the WRAP Courtauld Commitment 2030 and the British Retail \\nConsortium’s Climate Action Roadmap. We have also made \\ncommitments to RE100 and EV100, pledging to reach 100% \\nrenewable electricity and 100% electric van fleets respectively.\\nIntegration\\nIn 2022 we relaunched our purpose, placing sustainability at its \\ncore. We also added climate emissions to our Big 6 KPIs and \\nintroduced ESG metrics into our executive remuneration policy. \\nThe Performance Share Plan includes three ESG targets, including \\nour near-term emissions reduction milestone, each with an equal \\nweighting of 8.33% (25% in total). In 2021 climate became a \\nstandalone principal business risk, recognising the critical impact \\nclimate change has on our business. See page 14 for details on \\nour Big 6 KPIs. \\nTo underpin our new purpose and substantiate our public \\ncommitments, we have established Group-wide, interdepartmental \\ngovernance with accountability across the leadership team. Our \\ngovernance groups maintain oversight of progress made against \\nour interim decarbonisation milestones and have accountability \\nfor ensuring the business delivers on climate commitments. \\nAs a result of integrating climate change action throughout our \\nbusiness, we have been able to make further progress on \\nengagement and investment in decarbonisation.Working toward decarbonisation\\nThe majority of our GHG emissions come from producing the \\nthings we sell, and customers using what they buy from us, \\nmainly from fuel and energy. We are more able to influence the \\nway things are produced than how they are used, so our strategy \\nfocuses largely on decarbonising the upstream supply chain. \\nWhile transport, running our stores and waste are relatively \\nsmaller contributors, they are still significant and lie almost fully \\nwithin our control and therefore have a prominent role in our \\ndecarbonisation strategy. Our TCFD report starting on page 20 \\nprovides more detail on our emissions footprint.\\nScopes 1 and 2: running our stores  \\nand logistics\\nTo date, we have achieved a 55% absolute emissions reduction \\nin our own operations vs a 2015/16 baseline. This has largely been \\ndriven by switching to renewable electricity; however, we have \\nmaintained consistent focus on driving energy efficiencies while \\nmaking significant inroads into decarbonising our remaining key \\nhotspots. Our Group Scope 1 emissions now account for around \\none million tonnes of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e), split roughly a third \\neach across heating, refrigeration and transport. \\n –Refrigeration – we are switching the refrigerant gases in our \\nstore fridges to reduce emissions quickly and replacing \\ndepreciated systems with recovered CO2 systems to minimise \\nemissions. \\n –Heating – we have installed heat pumps in 13 stores in the \\nUK and are trialling 100% heat pump heated stores in \\nCzech Republic and Slovakia.\\n –Transport – as signatories of EV100, we are committed to having \\na fully electric home delivery fleet by 2030 and installing EV \\ncharging for customers and colleagues. \\nFurther information on the steps we have taken to drive energy \\nefficiency are contained within the Streamlined Energy and \\nCarbon Reporting disclosure on page 105.\\nWe have already met our 2030 ambition to switch to 100% \\nrenewable electricity in our own operations across the Group. \\nOur strategy is designed to ensure we increasingly source our \\nelectricity directly, going beyond renewable energy certificates \\nand supporting the development of new renewable assets, helping \\nbridge the gap in investment and infrastructure needed to hit the \\nUK’s net zero target. Our target is to source 60% of our electricity \\nby 2030 from power purchase agreements (PPAs) and onsite \\npower generation. \\nUnderpinning this work to transition to zero carbon energy \\nsources, it is imperative that we continually work to minimise \\nour overall energy demand, by investing in efficiencies across our \\nlogistics and store operations. This is a critical enabler to ensure \\nwe have sufficient capacity to electrify the elements of our \\noperations that continue to rely on fossil fuels. \\nScope 3\\nOur 2019/20 end to end footprint showed that more than 90% \\nof our GHG emissions sit in our value chain (Scope 3). Building a \\ncomprehensive supplier engagement programme, encouraging \\ncarbon reporting and reduction and finding active opportunities to \\ndecarbonise our Own Brand product range are critical steps in our \\nnet zero journey.

Our sustainability \\nefforts focus on our ability to create and preserve long-term value \\nfor our customers, colleagues, the planet and the communities \\nwe serve. To address the effect of climate change, Tesco has set \\nsustainability targets, aligned to a 1.5°C pathway, and has \\ncommitted to achieving net zero across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2050. \\nThese sustainability targets are underpinned by plans and formal \\noversight through dedicated forums, which continue to provide \\nsupport for delivering against our long-term targets.

In partnership with \\nRisilience, part of the Centre for Risk Studies at the University of \\nCambridge, this involved creating a ‘digital twin’ of our business. The digital twin maps the key areas of our value chain and allows \\nus to stress test our business under five warming scenarios, \\nfor both physical and transition risks. The output provides a \\nrange of financial value at risk impacts across several risk \\ncategories over the short to medium term, which are described \\nin more detail below. Each risk type was assessed based on \\nmateriality and likelihood within the five-year time frame on which \\nthe quantitative modelling is based. We can also leverage the \\noutputs from this model to estimate the longer-term exposure to \\neach risk category. Our enhanced scenario modelling capabilities \\nallow us to better understand the exposure of the business to the \\neffects of climate change, build effective mitigation plans, stress \\ntest our organisational resilience and improve the execution of \\nour net zero strategy. \\nThe tables overleaf summarise the financial value at risk \\nassociated with three of the modelled risk categories (policy, \\nconsumer and technology) over the short to medium term (five \\nyears) and a qualitative assessment of how these risks could \\nevolve over the longer term (10 to 20 years). The modelled impacts \\nrefer to transition risks and are quoted based on a 1.5°C pathway \\naligned to the Paris Ambition and Tesco’s stated targets, and a 3°C \\npathway aligned to the current warming pathway. We have quoted \\nthe financial value at risk below as a range, reflecting the uncertain \\nand heavily assumption-based nature of climate-related modelling.\\nWe assess that our business has a high degree of resilience to the \\nclimate-related risks detailed below across a spectrum of warming \\nscenarios, including one where warming is limited to 1.5°C. This \\nassessment is based on a variety of factors, which include:\\n –a broad, comprehensive range of grocery products and core \\ncapabilities in adapting our existing ranges while launching new \\nproducts to meet emerging consumer demands;\\n –an extensive plant-based meat alternative range, which we \\ncontinue to innovate; and\\n –a geographically diversified sourcing base characterised by \\nstrong and established strategic relationships with suppliers \\nacross the globe, which gives us a natural hedge against weather \\nextremities.\\nWe modelled three further transition risks in relation to: the risk of \\nclimate-related litigation, the risk of a negative shift in consumer \\nsentiment; and negative investor sentiment due to a perceived lack \\nof action to address climate change. We believe that stakeholders \\nrecognise our sustainability commitments and the progress we \\nhave made to date. This includes our significant investment in the \\ndecarbonisation of our property estate and transport fleet, our \\nmarket-leading sustainable product ranges, and the provision of the \\nlargest electric vehicle (EV) charging network of any UK supermarket.\\nWe also considered the potential financial impacts the Group \\ncould face as a result of physical risks, largely driven by the \\npotential for weather extremes and related to raw material supply, \\nkey facility risks, and market disruption. The geographically diverse \\nnature of our supply base as well as our store and distribution \\nnetwork provides a degree of structural resilience. Our enhanced \\nmodelling capabilities allow us to understand the potential physical \\nclimate risks at a site level. This enables our property teams to \\nensure we have robust plans in place in high-risk flood zones to \\nmitigate potential flood risks in the years ahead. The financial value \\nat risk is not material either individually or in aggregate, and we \\nhave therefore not disclosed these separately.\\nOur focus for the 2023/24 financial year will be on further exploring \\neach risk identified as part of this modelling and working with \\nrelevant business teams to develop our risk management and \\nmitigation plans.\\nStrategic report\\n21 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023', metadata={'source': 'pdf files/tesco.pdf', 'page': 22}),\n",

The \\nstrategic plan is reviewed and approved by the Board annually, \\nincluding a review of the key decarbonisation initiatives and \\nassociated costs and capital investments. Our review process \\nfor proposed capital investments ensures we understand how \\ndifferent projects will impact our emissions levels. This enables us \\nto balance the best carbon return for our investment, considering \\nthe maturity of emerging technologies and supply capacity. \\nBeyond our three-year strategic plan, we have also created a \\ncapital investment profile and associated decarbonisation impact \\nto 2035 to align to our own operations decarbonisation target. \\nWe understand that our best strategy to mitigate our main \\nphysical and transition climate risks is to become a net zero \\nbusiness across the whole Group, entailing fast, large-scale, and \\neffective decarbonisation of our operations and our supply chain. \\nTherefore, in 2021 we announced a renewed commitment to be \\nnet zero across the whole Group and all GHG emission scopes by \\n2050, while maintaining our own operational (Scope 1 and 2) target \\nof being net zero by 2035. As a company with a sizeable footprint \\nin the agricultural sector (roughly 25% of our Group GHG \\nemissions can be traced back to just 30 agricultural products), we \\nare the first retailer in the UK to join the design and validation pilot \\nof a decarbonisation target in the forest, land and agriculture \\n(FLAG) sectors. The chart below shows the disaggregation of our \\nfootprint according to Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG Protocol categories. \\nScope 1 and 2 have been updated with our 2022/23 emissions \\ndata and Scope 3 emissions are as of 2019/20.\\nOur priority will be to focus on finding the most scalable and \\neffective solutions to accelerate our decarbonisation across \\nall scopes. Our strategy will concentrate primarily on three \\nmain components:\\n1. continuing to reduce our operational footprint, with a focus on \\nincreasing energy efficiency, generating and directly procuring \\nrenewable electricity, reducing our dependency on fossil fuels \\nacross transport and our property estate and switching the \\nrefrigerants we use in our fresh network and stores;\\n2. enhancing supplier engagement across all business units, \\ngeographies and subsidiaries to ensure our supply chain is \\nadequately disclosing footprint data and setting targets to \\nreduce it; and\\n3. working directly with producers in our agricultural supply chains \\nto identify opportunities to reduce and sequester land-based \\nemissions associated with our own label product range.We are committed to reaching net zero Scope 1 and 2 operations \\nby 2035, on a 1.5°C aligned pathway. Since our baseline in 2015/16, \\nwe have reduced our Scope 1 and 2 Group footprint by 55%. While \\nthis has largely been driven by switching to renewable electricity, \\nwe have maintained consistent focus on driving energy efficiencies \\nwhile making significant inroads to decarbonise our remaining key \\nhotspots: transport; refrigeration; and heating. \\nWe led early on electricity; in 2020 we reached our RE100 \\ncommitment to 100% renewable electricity 10 years ahead \\nof our 2030 target. We designed our strategy to ensure we \\nincreasingly source our electricity directly via power purchase \\nagreements, going beyond renewable energy certificates to \\nhelp boost domestic UK renewable capacity. We have also \\ninstalled wind turbines at our depots and solar panels on our \\nstore roofs, supporting our energy security. In total, onsite and \\noffsite direct power deals will supply around a quarter of our \\nelectricity demand.\\nIt is critical that we de-risk our business from stranded assets, \\nwrite-off costs and potential future carbon legislation. We will \\ndo this by innovating early to scale up decarbonised operations \\nin line with our pathway towards net zero. We are switching away \\nfrom our depreciated HFC refrigerant systems to recovered CO 2 \\nsystems. To replace gas boilers, we are trialling air source heat \\npumps and heat reclaim systems across the UK and Central \\nEurope. We have several large fleets of vehicles to decarbonise. \\nTo date we have deployed 293 electric home delivery vans and are \\non track to be 100% electric by 2030 as we continue to replace \\nfully depreciated diesel vehicles. This prepares us for the UK’s \\nphase out of vehicles powered by internal combustion engine. \\nWe continue to trial various models across the UK and \\nCentral Europe as well as electrical refrigeration units in \\nour chilled network.\\nOur transition to zero carbon energy sources is underpinned by a \\nfocus on continually reducing our overall energy demand, through \\ninvesting in efficiencies across our logistics and store operations. \\nThis is a critical enabler to bolster our energy security, manage \\nenergy costs and secure sufficient capacity as we continue to \\nelectrify our operations.\\n1.4% \\n0.01%\\n50.2% \\n3.1%\\n \\n3.0%\\n \\n39.1% 1.5% \\n0.39%\\n1.3%Scope 3: category 12: end-of-life \\ntreatment of sold products\\nScope 3: category 15: investments\\nScope 3: category 3, 5, 6, 7: fuel and \\nenergy-related activities, waste \\ngenerated in operations, business \\ntravel and employee commuting76.6m  \\ntCO 2e/yearOur total emissions footprint\\nScope 1: refrigerants, HVAC, transport (logistics)\\nScope 2: purchased electricity\\nScope 3: category 1: purchased goods \\nand services (including deforestation)\\nScope 3: category 4: upstream \\ntransportation and distribution\\nScope 3: category 9: downstream \\ntransportation and distribution\\nScope 3: category 11: use of sold products\\nWe report on the categories that are material to Tesco based on their contribution to our end-to-end footprint.

       " Document(page_content='Alongside our operational decarbonisation roadmap, we are \\nsetting a comprehensive Group-wide strategy to decarbonise \\nour value chain. This is both upstream, with our suppliers, and \\ndownstream to support a sustainable transition in our customers’ \\npurchasing behaviour. This helps both to mitigate the risk of \\nconsumers shifting to our competitors because of sustainability \\npreferences and to insulate us against rising future carbon prices. \\nOur Scope 3 emissions constitute more than 90% of our total \\nemissions footprint. Upstream activities account for 50% of this, \\nwhile 30% is driven by emissions from rearing, growing and \\ntransporting agricultural products, mainly within the animal \\nprotein categories. The remaining 20% is linked to the \\nmanufacture of our product ranges, including packaging and \\nproduction of the fuel that we sell. Downstream activities \\nrepresent 40% of our footprint including primarily emissions \\nresulting from customers using our products. This includes \\ncooking at home, preparational processes including washing \\nand drying products, and the emissions associated with the \\nfuel that customers buy from our petrol filling stations. \\nOur two main strategic priorities for our upstream emissions \\nare strengthening our supplier engagement programme around \\ncarbon reporting and climate targets and working directly with \\nfarmers to scale up decarbonisation on farms. We have asked \\nall of our direct suppliers to report their GHG emissions and set \\nscience-based targets, which should aim for net zero across all \\nemission scopes and attain validation by the SBTi by the end of \\n2025. At January 2023, close to two-thirds of our UK suppliers by \\nvalue of total cost of goods sold (COGs) report their operational \\nfootprint. They do this either through CDP or directly to Tesco \\nby filling in a questionnaire that we circulate via the Tesco supplier \\nnetwork. Suppliers complying with our climate requirements are \\nalso eligible to join the UK retail sector’s first sustainability-linked \\nsupply chain finance programme. We launched this in 2021 in \\npartnership with Santander, offering preferential invoice \\npayment rates to climate-compliant suppliers. \\nIn 2023, we will build on the success of our supplier engagement \\nprogramme by joining Manufacture 2030, a global cross-industry \\nsoftware platform on which suppliers can submit their carbon \\ndata and other sustainability metrics to Tesco and our \\ncompetitors. This will enable us to increase coverage of our \\nsuppliers’ climate compliance to go beyond UK suppliers and \\ninclude an equivalent coverage of around 80% of all suppliers \\n(in terms of COGs) across the Tesco Group. We will also continue \\nour supply chain finance programme with Santander with a focus \\non supporting smaller suppliers who might require additional \\nresources to be able to comply with the climate requirements.\\nDecarbonising our agriculture and animal protein supply chains \\nis a priority to mitigate our transition risk. Our model has also \\nmapped the physical risk associated with sourcing these products \\nto understand where our exposure to at-risk commodities is \\ngreatest. Our main focus will be to decarbonise the three \\ncommercial categories with the highest dependency on these \\nproducts. These collectively represent close to 40% of production \\nemissions of which 75% is linked to our own label range: (i) meat, \\nfish, poultry and eggs; (ii) bakery and dairy; and (iii) produce. \\nWithin these three categories, we have identified the main \\nemission sources we must tackle. For example, in our ruminant \\nsupply chains, such as cattle and sheep, the focus will be on \\nimproving feed and protein efficiency while reducing methane \\nresulting from enteric fermentation.\\nIn monogastric animal supply chains, such as pork, poultry and \\naquaculture, the focus will be on ensuring that all feed comes \\nfrom 100% deforestation and conversion-free sources, a target \\nwe have committed to implement by 2025. When it comes to fresh produce, we are working on reducing our dependency \\non fossil-fuel fertilisers. In early 2023, we launched our first \\ncommercial trial of low-carbon fertiliser options with our \\nmain field vegetable suppliers in the UK. \\nMoving forward, we will continue to pilot decarbonisation \\ninterventions through our Tesco sustainable farming groups \\n(TSFGs), integrated by producers in the animal protein and \\nproduce sectors. We will also explore new ways to use supply \\nchain finance to support our farmers in their green transition.\\nWhen it comes to our downstream emissions, we launched our \\nBetter Baskets campaign in 2022, which helps our customers make \\ninformed decisions on the sustainability of their shopping basket. \\nOur Better Baskets on-shelf communication is available at all \\nTesco Extra stores and signposts consumers to a product range \\nwith enhanced sustainability credentials beyond carbon footprint \\nalone. Our commitment is to ensure 65% healthy sales by 2025 in \\nthe UK & ROI, and 53% by the end of 2027 in Central Europe, which \\nwill require scaling up the sustainability performance of our \\nproduct range. To that end, we will develop new product-level \\ndata collection platforms, such as Mondra. This UK-based \\nsustainability data start-up aims to estimate the environmental \\nfootprint of our own-label product range by understanding their \\ncomposition and the sourcing areas of their ingredients. We also \\ncontinue to ask our TSFGs to provide sustainability information \\nfrom their farms, so our commercial teams are better informed \\nabout the sustainability performance of our sourcing partners. \\nTo support the wider electrification of our customers’ vehicles, \\nwe have scaled up the network of pod points to more than 2,500 \\ncharging bays across 600 stores across the UK. We are also \\ncommitted to cutting food waste across the supply chain by 50% \\nby 2030. This is aligned with the WRAP Courtauld 2030 framework, \\nwhich will also entail working in customer-led campaigns to reduce \\nthe waste of our products in customers’ households.\\nIn line with UK Treasury regulatory requirements following COP26, \\nTesco will present our Group transition plan in accordance with UK \\nregulatory requirements and guidance from the Transition Plan Task \\nForce. This plan will give our stakeholders insight into our sector and \\nproduct-specific decarbonisation plans as well as details of our \\nsupplier engagement programme and more information on our \\nclimate risk mapping and financial planning. To ensure alignment \\nwith the guidelines and recommendations of the Transition Plan \\nTask Force, Tesco is part of a cohort of companies participating \\nactively in the consultation phase for the document’s \\nimplementation guidance.

We also launched a fava bean trial to help scale up this \\nUK-native, low-carbon alternative protein to pea and soya, \\nincluding using it as an ingredient and as alternative feed for pigs.\\nWe have made further progress towards our commitment to be \\ncarbon neutral in our own operations by 2035.

       " Document(page_content='Risk identification and prioritisation\\nA complete view of our risk universe starts with the analysis of our \\nbusiness, the external environment within which we operate, the \\nregulatory landscape and our internal operations. This includes the \\nimpacts on our strategy, initiatives, governance, and processes. \\nWe use a consistent assessment criterion to identify and prioritise \\nrisks at the Group, functional, and business unit level, along with \\nhorizon scanning for emerging risk themes. The identified risks are \\ncategorised into one or more of the following risk types: strategic, \\nchange, operational, finance or compliance. This enables effective \\ngovernance and monitoring of the risks.\\nManagement assesses the risks on a continuous basis, taking \\ninto account the risk to Tesco’s strategy, our colleagues and \\nour operations, as well as our impact on society and the \\nenvironment. There is regular formal oversight through clearly \\ndefined governance structures, e.g. the Cyber risk committee \\noversees the various elements of the cyber security risk. \\nRisk controls and responses\\nFor risks where our risk appetite is low, termed, ‘risks requiring \\nstandards’, we take a robust and uniform approach to determine \\nappropriate risk controls and responses, leaving no room for \\ndiscretion or deviation. For these risks (typically regulatory and \\ncompliance risks) we have established policies and blueprints \\nto guide the business in managing the risks. These risks are \\nmonitored formally by one or more of our various governance \\nbodies, such as our Group risk and compliance committee, \\nPrivacy executive committee and Investment committee, as \\nwell as, biannually by the Audit Committee. For other risks, \\ntermed, ‘risks requiring judgements’, which are typically \\nstrategic, pervasive, or dynamic in nature, the risk controls \\nand responses are determined on a case-by-case basis in line \\nwith the strategic goals of the organisation. We determine \\nappropriate risk responses by measuring against the target risk \\nscore that articulates the risk appetite, after considering any \\nexisting risk mitigations.\\nGovernance and monitoring\\nA strong risk culture is at the heart of our Risk management \\nframework with clear risk ownership and proactive leadership.  \\nThe responsibility for identifying, assessing, escalating, and \\nmanaging risks resides with management at a functional, business \\nunit and executive level. The Board has overall responsibility for \\nrisk management and is actively engaged in risk discussions.  \\nThe Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, undertakes an \\nannual effectiveness assessment of the risk management \\nframework, as well as, detailed reviews of the risks twice a year,  \\nto support the external reporting process, see page 75. The Group \\nrisk and compliance committee is responsible for the oversight of \\nkey risks on behalf of the Executive Committee. During the year, \\nthe Chief Audit and Risk Officer (CARO) left the business, and a \\nPwC audit partner acted in an intermediary capacity to oversee \\nthe function. A new CARO joined in April 2023.Audit and assurance\\nAssurance over risks requiring standards is robust and integrated \\nacross all three lines of defence. To mitigate these risks, the \\nsecond-line functions such as, finance controls, ethics and \\ncompliance, safety, responsible sourcing, technology compliance, \\nand people compliance, systematically test the processes and \\ncontrols established by management.\\nGroup Audit undertakes functional reviews on a rotational \\nbasis over the effectiveness of the first two lines of defence. \\nIt also carries out targeted controls testing for the risk \\nrequiring standards. For risks requiring judgements, Group \\nAudit undertakes risk-based internal audits to ensure \\nsufficient risk coverage.\\nPrincipal risks and uncertainties\\nThe most significant risks – those that could affect our strategic \\nambitions, future performance, viability, and/or reputation – form \\nour principal risks.\\nThe table sets out our principal risks.

We also highlight \\nprincipal risks that are included in our long-term viability \\nscenarios, see page 46.\\nAt present, there continues to be a heightened level of \\nmacroeconomic uncertainty relating to cost and wage inflation, \\nas well as energy supply issues, leading to rising prices, which are \\ncontinuing to impact our customers’ disposable income, thereby \\nchanging the way they shop.

The plan delivers the Group’s purpose of \\n‘serving our customers, communities and planet a little better \\nevery day’ and is underpinned by a clear strategic focus on \\ncreating sustainable, long-term value for every Tesco stakeholder. \\nThe Group conducts an annual strategic planning process, \\ncomprising a comprehensive reassessment of progress against \\nthe Group’s strategic objectives, alongside an evaluation of the \\nlonger-term opportunities and risks in each market in which \\nthe Group operates. The process for identifying the principal \\nand emerging risks in each market is an important input to \\nthis process. \\nThe Group’s strategic plan and viability statement are both \\nconsidered over a three-year period, as this time horizon \\nmost appropriately reflects the dynamic and changing retail \\nenvironment in which the Group operates. \\nLong-term planning process \\nThe long-term planning process builds from the Group’s current \\nposition and considers the evolution of the strategic objectives \\nover the next three years. Three years is selected as the Group’s \\nplanning horizon and viability period based on the pace of change \\nin both the competitive landscape and customer shopping \\nbehaviours within the retail sector. \\nCurrent position \\nOur multi-year performance framework, strategic drivers and \\ncapital allocation framework, which were announced in 2021, \\ncontinue to guide management’s actions. The multi-year \\nperformance framework sets out the objectives of the business: \\nto drive top-line growth; to grow absolute profits while maintaining \\nsector leading margins; and to generate stable retail free cash flow \\neach year. The delivery of these objectives will enable the Group \\nto maintain a strong balance sheet, invest for growth and deliver \\nimproved returns for shareholders.Management recognise that customers across the Group currently \\nface significant cost-of-living pressures, and continue to prioritise \\noffering great value during these challenging times, while delivering \\nsustainable growth, supported by:\\n –A strategic focus on driving growth and continued focus on cost \\nreduction from simplification of the operating model;\\n –A clear set of financial priorities to deliver cash profit, free cash \\nflow and earnings per share growth, underpinned by a robust \\ncapital allocation framework; and\\n –A diversified business portfolio covering retail, wholesale, \\nbanking and data science.\\nRefer to the Group Chief Executive’s review from page 8 and the \\nFinancial review on pages 30 to 37 for further detail regarding the \\nGroup’s strategic and financial progress. \\nLonger-term prospects \\nThe following factors are considered both in the formulation of \\nthe Group’s strategic plan, and in the longer-term assessment \\nof the Group’s prospects:\\n –The principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group, as well \\nas emerging risks as they are identified, and the Group’s \\nresponse to these;\\n –The prevailing economic climate and global economy, \\ncompetitor activity, market dynamics and changing customer \\nbehaviours;\\n –Any structural changes in how customers shop, additional costs \\nincurred by the Group and potential macroeconomic \\nconsequences of rising unemployment and inflation due to \\ngeopolitical events and global supply challenges;\\n –Opportunities for further cost reduction through operational \\nsimplification and leveraging technology; and \\n –The resilience afforded by the Group’s operational scale.\\nAssessing the Group’s viability\\nThe viability of the Group has been assessed, considering the \\nGroup’s current financial position, including external funding in \\nplace over the assessment period, and after modelling the impact \\nof certain scenarios arising from the Group’s principal risks \\noutlined on pages 38 to 45. \\nFour ‘severe but plausible’ hypothetical scenarios have been \\nmodelled which address the principal risks that the Group has \\nassessed would have the most direct and material impact on the \\nGroup. None of these scenarios, either individually or in aggregate \\nthreaten the viability of the Group. The hypothetical scenarios \\ndescribed are also used as the basis for the risk-weighted cash \\nflows which are included in our impairment of non-current asset \\nsensitivity analysis.

       " Document(page_content='ScenarioAssociated  \\nprincipal risk Description\\nRecessionary \\nimpacts on \\ncustomer \\ndisposable \\nincome –Competition and \\nmarkets\\n –CustomerGlobal economies are facing elevated levels of inflation and rising interest rates. The resultant \\nimpact on disposable incomes, employment rates and consumer confidence contributes \\ntowards a contraction in customer demand, driving like-for-like sales decline across our retail \\nbusinesses. To deliver our medium-term performance ambitions and maintain our competitive \\nposition in such a recessionary environment, further investment in our value proposition will be \\nrequired which puts pressure on operating margins. Management have applied a downside \\nscenario which reduces the projected like-for-like sales growth in each of the three years of the \\nGroup strategic plan by (5)%, increased from (4)% in last year’s modelling to account for further \\ndownside risk given unprecedented disposable income impacts in the prior year. To maintain our \\ncompetitive position in such a recessionary environment, further investment in our value \\nproposition will be required which puts pressure on operating margins. In addition, management \\nhave considered the potential for customers to manage a contraction in disposable incomes by \\nswitching from more expensive to lower-priced ranges. Management have applied a downside \\nscenario in this instance which assumes 1% of the existing sales in higher-priced ranges transfers \\ninto lower-priced and lower-margin ranges. \\nGlobal supply \\npressures –Responsible \\nsourcing\\n –Financial \\nperformance\\n –Security of supplyGeopolitical events, availability of labour and commodity shortages drive high domestic inflation \\nin the markets in which we operate, which results in significant cost inflation. The Group absorbs \\nelevated levels of cost inflation across goods purchased for sale to customers and the operating \\ncost base, particularly in costs related to colleague payroll. The ability of the Group to manage \\nthese cost tensions through cost savings or retail pricing is constrained. Management have \\napplied a downside scenario which assumes the Group absorbs further cost inflation in colleague \\npay and cost of goods sold. These cost tensions are assumed to be fully absorbed by the Group, \\nwith no assumed mitigation through additional cost savings or retail pricing. The adverse \\nconsumer impact from this risk is dealt with in the recessionary impacts on customer disposable \\nincome scenario described above.\\nClimate \\nchange –Climate change \\n –Responsible \\nsourcing \\n –Political, regulatory \\nand complianceGlobal action to address rising temperatures results in a shift in consumer sentiment towards \\nmore sustainable products and an increase in carbon taxes levied against Group emissions. \\nThe costs associated with these risks are based on our climate-related risk modelling, which is \\ndescribed in further detail in the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) \\nsection, starting on page 20. The viability modelling estimates the potential annual financial \\nimpact on the Group of three key risk areas, covering consumer sentiment, technology write \\noffs and policy (carbon pricing) risks, based on a 3°C warming pathway. \\nData breach  –Cyber security \\n –Political, regulatory \\nand compliance \\n –Customer\\n –Data privacyThe volume and nature of the customer and supplier data we hold as a business could result in a \\nserious data or security breach which sees a significant financial penalty levied against the Group, \\naligned to the UK GDPR penalty framework which could see a maximum fine levied of 4% of \\nGroup revenue. For the purposes of this stress test, management have included a fine quantified \\nas 2% of Group revenue, being the mid-point of the potential maximum fine. A significant data \\nbreach poses a reputational risk, resulting in a decline in customer sentiment and an adverse \\ntrading impact. The extent of this trading impact is very uncertain, both in terms of the financial \\nimpact and the period it may take to recover customer trust. As such, the potential brand \\nreputation element of this scenario has been modelled via a ‘reverse stress test’. This assesses \\nthe risk in the context of the residual headroom after all other scenarios have been applied. \\nThe resultant like-for-like sales decline which would have to occur to eliminate the residual cash \\nheadroom, including all other scenarios happening in aggregate, is around twice as severe as any \\ndecline the Group has faced in recent years. \\nWe expect to be able to refinance external debt and renew committed facilities as they become due, which is the assumption made in the \\nviability scenario modelling. Our committed facilities remain undrawn as at the end of the financial year. Please refer to Note 21 of the \\nfinancial statements for further details on our debt profile, including maturity dates. The scenarios above are hypothetical and purposefully \\nsevere with the aim of creating outcomes that could threaten the viability of the Group. In the case of these scenarios arising, various \\noptions are available to the Group in order to maintain liquidity to continue in operation, such as: (i) accessing new external funding early; (ii) \\nshort-term cost reduction actions; and (iii) reducing capital expenditure. None of these mitigating actions are assumed in our current \\nscenario modelling. \\nViability statement\\nBased on these severe but plausible scenarios, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company will continue in operation and \\nmeet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period considered.\\nThis Strategic report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the \\nCompanies Act 2006, and has been approved and signed on behalf of the Board.  \\nRobert Welch\\nGroup Company Secretary  \\n12 April 2023\\nStrategic report\\n47 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023', metadata={'source': 'pdf files/tesco.pdf', 'page': 48}),\n",

The matrix below details the skills and experience that \\ncollectively, the Non-executive Directors bring to the Board. \\nThe Non-executive Directors provide a strong independent \\nelement to the Board and the oversight they provide is balanced \\nwith individuals contributing a broad range of skills, diverse \\nexperience and knowledge, demonstrating independence and \\nconstructive challenge. Relationships between the Directors are \\nbased on trust and mutual respect, enabling open and frank \\nconversations. This ensures that even the most challenging \\ndecisions are taken for the benefit of the Company, with due \\nconsideration for those stakeholders who may be affected. \\nAppointments\\nNon-executive Directors are initially appointed for a three-year \\nterm with an expectation that they will continue for at least a \\nfurther three years. In accordance with their letter of \\nappointment, after three years’ service the performance of a \\nNon-executive Director is rigorously assessed by the Nominations \\nand Governance Committee, with any development needs \\ndiscussed by the Chair with the Non-executive Director. \\nDirectors are nominated by the Nominations and Governance \\nCommittee and are subsequently approved by the Board for \\nelection or re-election annually by shareholders at the Company’s \\nAGM. The Nominations and Governance Committee have \\nundertaken an assessment of each of the Directors’ experience, \\nskills, independence, time commitments, conflicts and the Board \\nbelieves that all Directors continue to be effective and committed \\nto their roles. All Directors, with the exception of Lindsey Pownall \\nwho will retire in June 2023, will submit themselves for election or \\nre-election at the forthcoming AGM in June 2023. The Board \\nrecommends that shareholders be supportive of their election or \\nre-election to the Board.\\nDetails of the Directors’ service contracts and terms \\nof appointment, together with their interests in the \\nCompany’s shares, are shown in the Directors’ \\nremuneration report on pages 77 to 101.Induction programme\\nNew Director induction programmes are delivered through: \\n –meetings with senior managers across the business; \\n –meetings with advisors;\\n –attendance at Committee meetings;\\n –site visits to stores, urban fulfilment and distribution \\ncentres, providing an opportunity to meet colleagues and \\nsee at first hand the business operations; and \\n –access to a library of reference materials.\\nDirectors’ feedback is that the comprehensive induction \\nprogramme provides great insight into the business operations, \\ngovernance and controls, with an opportunity to meet \\ncolleagues within the business.\\nFinancial\\nStrategy\\nRisk\\nRetail\\nMarketing\\nSupply chain/logistics\\nInternational\\nTechnology and digital\\nSustainability4\\n10\\n4\\n3\\n6\\n8\\n310\\n4Board skills and experienceInduction and development\\nAll new Directors receive a comprehensive induction programme \\nover a number of months which is designed to facilitate their \\nunderstanding of the business and is tailored to their individual \\nneeds.

The Board believes that having a diverse leadership team \\nand an open and inclusive culture where everyone is welcome \\nsupports one of our core values: We treat people how they want \\nto be treated. The Board’s diversity and inclusion policy sits \\nalongside the Company’s various diversity and inclusion policies. \\nThese policies support the Company’s wider commitment to \\nbuilding an increasingly diverse business where all colleagues \\nare given equal opportunities through recruitment, learning \\nand development. \\nThe Board believes that it is vital to have a diverse Board, with \\nthe right balance of skills, knowledge and experience across \\nprofessional backgrounds, gender, tenure, age, ethnicity and \\ndiversity of thought. A diverse Board with different perspectives, \\ninsights and viewpoints in decision making ultimately benefits the \\nGroup’s stakeholders through better business performance and \\ndecision making. The Board takes into account the recommendations \\nof the FTSE Women Leaders and Parker Review on gender and \\nethnic diversity. As part of the annual Board effectiveness review, \\nthe Board considers the diversity of the Board, its Committees and \\nthe Executive Committee. The Committee reviews the Board’s \\ndiversity and inclusion policy in detail each year and monitors the \\nprogress against the policy. During the year, updates were proposed \\nand recommended to the Board for approval, including an \\nincrease in the diversity target from 33% to 40% of women on the \\nBoard in line with the Listing Rule requirements proposed by The \\nFinancial Conduct Authority (FCA) in April 2022 applying to financial \\nperiods beginning on or after 1 April 2022. The current Board \\ndiversity and inclusion policy was approved by the Board in \\nOctober 2022. The policy objectives are detailed in the table \\nbelow. The Committee will consider the latest recommendations \\nfrom the Parker Review when conducting its annual review of the \\nBoard diversity and inclusion policy.\\nBoard diversity and inclusion policy\\nPolicy objectives Implementation Progress against objectives \\nCommitment to achieve a minimum \\nof 40% female representation on the \\nBoard by the end of 2024.Regular succession planning sessions are undertaken \\nthroughout the year to ensure that the balance, skills \\nand experiences required to deliver on the strategic \\nobjectives are in place over the short, medium and \\nlong term.Currently at 42% female representation \\non the Board.\\nCommitment to have at least one \\nwoman in the role of a senior member \\nof the Board, being the Chair, CEO, \\nCFO or Senior Independent Director, \\nby the end of 2024.The Board is supportive of the FCA proposals, noting \\nthe comply or explain basis.

       " Document(page_content='Board effectiveness\\nThe Board and senior management set the tone from the top \\nand lead by example through effective management and good \\nstewardship. Effectiveness of the Board encompasses many \\naspects of Board governance including: composition; skills and \\nexpertise; independence; time commitments; conflicts of interest; \\nand Director re-election. The Committee undertakes detailed \\nreviews of each of these aspects at least annually, but \\nadditionally as part of the succession planning discussions \\nthroughout the year.\\nTime commitments\\nThe Board recognises the importance of all Non-executive \\nDirectors having the necessary time to commit to the business. \\nUpon appointment, Non-executive Directors letters of \\nappointment stipulate the expected time commitment while \\nacknowledging that this may vary depending upon the demands \\nof the business and other events. All Directors make themselves \\nfreely available as required, even at short notice, in order to meet \\nthe needs of the business. The Committee regularly assesses the \\nother time commitments of Directors to ensure that each \\nNon-executive Director continues to have sufficient time to \\ndevote to their role. This assessment takes into account the \\nnumber and nature of the external commitments each Director \\nhas, and considers whether each Director has demonstrated \\nthey have sufficient time to devote to their present role within \\nTesco, including under potential periods of corporate stress.\\nAs previously stated, the Board was disappointed by the voting \\noutcome during the 2022 AGM relating to the re-election of \\nBertrand Bodson. The Committee discussed the matter at length \\nafter the 2022 AGM and the shareholder consultation which \\nfollowed. Directors are required to seek approval before accepting \\nany additional external appointments. The Board continues to \\nfirmly believe that Bertrand had sufficient time to devote to his \\nTesco role, despite his other external roles. Bertrand has since \\ndecided to step down as a member of the Supervisory Board of \\nWolters Kluwer N.V. with effect from 10 May 2023.\\nThe Board is currently satisfied that the number of appointments \\nheld by each Director in addition to their position with Tesco is \\nappropriate to allow them to fulfil their obligations to Tesco. \\nDuring the year, approval was granted to Stewart Gilliland, \\nByron Grote, Alison Platt and Caroline Silver to take on \\nadditional directorships. It was determined that the additional \\ntime commitment, taking into account their current overall \\nresponsibilities, would not have an effect on their \\ncommitment to Tesco as a Non-executive Director.\\nIndependence\\nThe Non-executive Directors provide a strong independent \\nelement to the Board and a solid foundation for good corporate \\ngovernance, fulfilling the vital role of corporate accountability. \\nThe Committee formally reviews the independence of each of \\nour Non-executive Directors at least annually. The Committee is \\nof the opinion that each of the current Non-executive Directors \\ncontinues to be independent in character and judgement in line \\nwith the definition set out in the Code. In assessing each Director’s \\nindependence, the Committee concluded that each provides \\nobjective challenge, strategic guidance, hold management to \\naccount and is willing to stand up and defend their own beliefs.Conflicts of interest\\nIn accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and the Company’s \\nArticles of Association, Directors are required to report actual or \\npotential conflicts of interest to the Board for consideration and, \\nif appropriate, authorisation. If such conflicts exist, Directors \\nexcuse themselves from consideration of the relevant matter. \\nOn behalf of the Board, the Committee reviews the register of \\nauthorised conflicts of interests at least annually to confirm its \\nongoing authorisation of any potential or actual conflicts arising \\nfrom a Director’s interest. During the period, in reviewing the \\ncumulative conflicts of interests of each of the Directors, the \\nCommittee concluded that no Director had a conflict that would \\nhave a detrimental impact on their independence and judgement \\nor their time commitment to Tesco. \\nAnnual election and re-election\\nAnnually, the Committee considers and recommends to the Board \\nthe re-election of Directors by shareholders at the AGM. This is \\nsupported by each Director’s individual assessment undertaken \\nas part of the annual Board evaluation process. The Committee \\nconcluded that there were no reasons identified to prevent any \\nDirector from being recommended for election and re-election \\nat the 2023 AGM.\\nAdditionally, in accordance with the Non-executive Directors’ \\nletters of appointment, the Committee also carries out a rigorous \\nreview of performance when a Non-executive Director reaches \\nthree years’ and six years’ service taking into account the \\nDirector’s commitment, contribution and effectiveness. No \\nDirector reached their three or six-year review during the period.\\nBoard evaluation\\nThe Committee oversees the Board evaluation process. During \\nthe year, the Committee reviewed the progress of the actions \\nidentified through the 2021/22 Board evaluation and discussed \\nwhether any further actions would be desirable. In addition, the \\nCommittee reviewed the proposed approach to the 2022/23 \\nevaluation of the Board, Committees and Directors, considering \\nthe key themes and focus of the review. \\nAn internal review of the Committee’s effectiveness was \\nconducted during the year, details of which are set out on \\npage 66.\\nFull details of the 2022/23 Board evaluation \\nare provided on page 61.\\nJohn Allan CBE\\nNominations and Governance Committee ChairCorporate governance report continued\\nNominations and Governance Committee continued\\n68 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023', metadata={'source': 'pdf files/tesco.pdf', 'page': 69}),\n",

In addition, the Committee decided to \\nchange its name from the Corporate Responsibility Committee \\nto the Sustainability Committee, with effect from April 2023, \\nto better reflect the Committee’s responsibilities.\\nComplementing the Committee’s role, the Audit Committee is \\nresponsible for overseeing the assurance programme of Tesco’s \\nsustainability commitments and the Remuneration Committee \\nfor monitoring and approving sustainability-linked performance \\nmetrics and the alignment of senior executives’ individual \\nobjectives with sustainability goals. We collaborate closely with \\nthese Committees and cross-Committee representation \\nprovides a link between all the Board Committees.\\nSustainability strategy\\nThe effects of climate change and nature loss are becoming ever \\nmore apparent and increasingly urgent. Sustainability is integrated \\ninto the Group’s overall strategy, with reducing the environmental \\nimpact of our own and our supplier partners’ operations a key \\nprinciple of one of the Group’s strategic drivers, Magnetic value \\nfor customers. The Board is committed to becoming carbon \\nneutral across Group operations by 2035 and net zero across the \\nsupply chain by 2050. The Committee’s role is to provide oversight \\nand challenge on any material sustainability matters identified, \\nadvising and making recommendations to the Board where \\nappropriate. The Committee is satisfied that good progress \\ncontinues to be made in understanding and managing both risks \\nand opportunities across the business. Further information can \\nbe found in the Climate and TCFD sections on pages 18 to 24.\\nThe Committee has developed a sustainability framework to \\nmonitor progress against sustainability plans, KPIs and key \\nmilestones, measuring brand perception against our most \\nmaterial issues. This is considered alongside our planet plan which \\nprovides a framework for all areas of the business to align in terms \\nof environmental performance and managing our environmental \\nsustainability commitments. A sustainability dashboard provides a \\nview of the Group’s performance which helps to ensure we stay \\nahead of expectations, drive change and show transparency in our \\nreporting. Deep dives into material issues support the Committee \\nin overseeing and challenging management in the delivery of our \\nsustainability targets. All activities play a part in helping us to \\ndecarbonise our business and supply chains.\\nIt is important for our stakeholders to be aware of and \\nunderstand the actions we are taking on sustainability initiatives. \\nThe Committee reviews the annual customer and colleague \\ncommunications plan along with quarterly communication \\nupdates, which provide an overview of the activity supporting \\nour key sustainability themes. For example, our Better Baskets \\ninitiative through our partnership with WWF; campaigns relating \\nto packaging and food waste; innovation initiatives; and the roll \\nout of solar panels to power refrigeration units on HGVs reducing \\nour carbon footprint. \\nMaterial sustainability matters \\nDuring the year, the Committee received deep dive presentations \\non a number of key issues, including:\\n –our healthy sustainable diets programme, detailing performance \\nagainst our health strategy and commitments, the challenges \\nfaced and how these challenges were being addressed through \\nthe Better Baskets initiative, reformulation of Own Brand lines \\nand new launches of healthy products. The Committee noted \\nthe good progress being made towards the target of 65% of \\nUK & ROI sales coming from healthy food by 2025; –responsible farming and sustainable agriculture, reviewing our \\npriorities to help to ensure Tesco has long-term sustainable \\nsupply chains that meet our customer and shareholder \\nexpectations, support British agriculture, animal health and \\nwelfare, and protect and restore nature, in addition to meeting \\nour net zero ambitions;\\n –packaging and food waste, including a review of our strategy \\nand monitoring our commitment to halve food waste across \\nour own operations by 2025. An update on eliminating waste \\ndemonstrated the progress against our ‘4Rs’ packaging plan \\nto reduce or remove packaging, together with an update on \\nprogress against our food waste plan for 2022, and the work \\nundertaken to redistribute food through our charity \\npartnerships. We also oversaw, a number of innovative \\nprojects to make use of food waste, including exploring the \\nuse of insects as an alternative protein for animal feed; and\\n –sourcing and human rights, reviewing our human rights \\nstrategy and managing human rights risks.\\nGovernance and stakeholder engagement\\nFollowing the refresh of the Group’s purpose in October 2021 and \\nthe renewed focus on the most material issues of our strategy, \\nthe Committee has undertaken a review of matters scheduled \\nthroughout the year for discussion at its meetings to ensure it \\nhas a detailed understanding of the key issues and challenges \\nfaced in delivering against our sustainability targets.\\nThe Committee is a passionate advocate for transparency and \\nstakeholder engagement and continues to work on sustainability \\nissues alongside key stakeholders and investors. As part of our \\nstakeholder engagement, the Committee regularly receives \\nupdates from the Investor Relations team to understand the views \\nof our major investors. In addition, during one of its meetings the \\nCommittee had the opportunity to hear the views of a number of \\nour major shareholders first hand, in a dedicated feedback \\nsession. Committee members also had the opportunity to \\nparticipate in ESG investor roundtables, bringing insight and \\nchallenge back to the business.\\nEmpowering our stores, our colleagues and our customers to \\nmake a bigger difference locally, and finding new ways everyone \\ncan play a part in supporting the local community, is a key part \\nof our purpose. Throughout the year the Committee received \\nupdates on the Group’s community initiatives and their impact. \\nGiven the impact of the economic crisis on many of Tesco’s \\ncustomers, the Committee explored Tesco’s long-standing \\nrelationship with FareShare and The Trussell Trust who, through \\ndonated food from Tesco and others, help feed people in \\ncommunities. In addition, Committee members visited a branch \\nof the Hackney Foodbank, see page 62. To support these charities, \\nTesco held its annual winter and summer food collections, with \\nTesco customers donating 3.8 million meals and Tesco topping up \\nevery donation by 20%. The Committee also reviewed a number of \\nother community activities, the details of which are set out in the \\nStakeholder engagement section.\\nDuring 2021/22, the Group undertook a share forfeiture \\nprogramme following a tracing and notification exercise which \\ncompleted in 2022/23.

The Committee also considered the appropriateness \\nof a three-year viability assessment period after modelling the \\nimpact of certain scenarios arising from the Group’s principal \\nrisks: recessionary impacts, global supply pressures, climate \\nchange and data breach. The Committee received updates on \\nperceived challenges and viability impact that the business could \\nface resulting from climate change and broader macroeconomic \\nuncertainties. The Committee evaluated going concern over an \\n18-month period, which included a review of financial plans and \\nassumptions, access to financing and operational risk management, \\ncontingent liabilities, and the adaptability of financial plans. In our \\nreview of the financial statements, we considered, and challenged \\nas appropriate, the accounting policies and the significant \\njudgements and estimates underpinning the financial statements.\\nThe Committee received updates from the triennial pension \\nscheme valuation and discussed measures to further de-risk the \\nTesco UK Scheme and the impact of improving commutation \\nfactors and the resulting increase in liabilities.

We assessed the effectiveness of the Group’s \\nwhistleblowing arrangements and reviewed compliance with \\nGSCOP. The Committee monitors the relationship with the \\nGroceries Code Adjudicator and receives reports on supplier \\nengagement and the internal auditing of ethical business \\nprocesses. See page 104 for more information.\\nRisk management\\nThe Committee reviewed the Group’s principal and emerging risks \\nand mitigation strategies, with particular discussion of prioritised \\nrisks and risk movements. We also discussed the complexity of the \\nGroup’s supply chains and the threat of frequent disruption to \\nproduct availability due to increased volatility in external \\nconditions. It was considered appropriate to adopt security of \\nsupply as a new principal risk, which was considered and approved \\nby the Board. The Committee received updates on various \\nemerging risk themes in areas such as technology, economics, \\npolitical impacts, talent, climate and sustainability, including \\nperiodic deep dive sessions, see page 39. These are considered by \\nmanagement in connection with the risk assessment process. An \\nassessment of the Group’s principal risks and detailed scenario \\nanalysis work to stress test liquidity was performed as part of the \\nviability scenario modelling.

One such improvement included the development \\nof a bespoke test environment mapped to Tesco, which allows for \\nthe modelling of potential financial impacts of climate change. \\nFurthermore, we can monitor the evolution of these risks over \\ntime. The Committee was satisfied that the Group had complied \\nwith all recommendations having reviewed the outcome of \\nassessments in the prior and current year. \\nThe Committee reviewed the sustainability KPI assurance \\nprogramme, including the mix of internal and external assurance \\nprovided. Deloitte were engaged to perform independent assurance \\nover the non-financial metrics detailed in this Annual Report.The Committee scrutinised the integrity of governance and \\ncontrols around the quality of internal data points. The Group \\ncontinue to work towards greater assurance over TCFD \\ndisclosures and, with the support of Deloitte, will undertake \\na gap analysis of the 2023 TCFD statement, in parallel to the \\nremeasurement of total carbon footprint, ahead of moving \\nto a statement with limited assurance.\\nThe Committee reviewed the Group’s renewal of its revolving \\ncredit facility (RCF). The RCF’s sustainability link was also \\nconsidered in the context of the Group’s viability position and \\nupdated to better reflect the overall ESG strategy and alignment \\nwith KPIs used in the Group’s performance share plan. The \\nCommittee will continue to discuss the appropriate use of \\nESG-related metrics within its current and future funding strategy \\nand the mechanism for ESG assessment.

We also \\noversaw the complex buyback of property bonds in the form of \\nsecured debt. The Committee considered the accounting \\nimplications and impact to the Group’s net debt position. \\nA possible amendment to the APM definition was considered, \\nhowever, the Committee were comfortable that no change \\nwas required.\\nKey financial controls\\nThe ongoing financial controls compliance programme is well \\nprogressed to support a formal attestation on controls \\neffectiveness required as part of pending regulatory reforms. \\nThe Committee reviewed the scope of compliance work \\nundertaken and the approach. Updates on progress towards \\nenhanced corporate governance compliance and other control \\nimprovements were provided from the CFOs of UK & ROI and \\nCentral Europe operations. The effectiveness of key financial \\ncontrols is reviewed annually, and controls testing carried out. \\nControls would remain subject to other assurance activities, \\nincluding by Group Audit who will test the primary key financial \\ncontrols on a regular basis and report their findings to the \\nCommittee. No significant or material control issues have been \\nidentified. Regulatory developments will continue to be monitored \\nand the project plan adapted accordingly as the landscape \\ndevelops.\\nCyber security programme\\nThe Committee was regularly updated on the Group’s cyber risk \\nmanagement and the activities of the Group’s cyber risk \\ncommittee, set up to oversee effective governance protocols \\nover cyber security activities across the Group. More details on \\nthe continued monitoring of cyber risk can be found on page 40.\\nIT general controls\\nThe Committee continued to monitor the implementation of \\nrecommendations to further enhance the Group’s financial \\nreporting systems and controls environment. The Committee \\nreceived regular updates in relation to several remediation \\nworkstreams addressing IT general control weaknesses raised \\nby Deloitte as management letter points. Testing of the access \\nmanagement environment in mainframe and non-mainframe \\nenvironments was ongoing. Several improvements were identified \\nto be implemented to remove reliance on manual steps. \\nThe Committee will continue to explore the additional controls \\nrequired by compliance measures and understand the breadth \\nof the control environment.Key discussions in the year\\nCorporate governance\\n73 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023', metadata={'source': 'pdf files/tesco.pdf', 'page': 74}),\n",

The Committee also considered the Group’s financing facilities and future \\nfunding plans. Based on this, the Committee confirmed that the application of the going concern basis for the \\npreparation of the financial statements continued to be appropriate, with no material uncertainties noted, and \\nrecommended the approval of the viability statement.

For further information, see Notes 7 and 33 to the financial statements.\\nImpairment The Committee reviewed and challenged management’s impairment testing of goodwill, in particular in relation to Tesco \\nBank, and the Group’s portfolio of store cash-generating units. The Committee considered the key assumptions and \\nmethodologies for both value in use models and fair value measurements in order to conclude on the appropriateness of \\nthe impairment losses and reversals recognised. This included challenging projected cash flows, discount rates and the \\nuse of independent third-party valuations as well as considering the uncertainties arising from a macroeconomic \\ndownturn, higher levels of operating cost inflation and climate change.

The assessment highlighted the strong independence \\nof the team and noted their capabilities. Having considered the \\nresults of this assessment, as well as through ongoing review and \\noversight of the assurance activities, the Committee were \\nsatisfied with the effectiveness of Group Audit.\\nIn the year, the Committee approved the Group risk charter, \\nwhich defines the accountabilities for conducting risk \\nmanagement activities, ensuring transparency and a clear line \\nof separation to preserve the independence of Group Risk \\nand Group Audit from the business.\\nInternal controls\\nManagement is responsible for identifying and managing risks, and \\nfor maintaining a sound system of internal control. The internal \\ncontrol framework is intended to effectively manage rather than \\neliminate the risk of failure to achieve our business objectives. It \\ncan only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against \\nthe risk of material misstatement or financial loss. The key \\nelements of the Group’s internal control framework are monitored \\nthroughout the year, and the Committee has conducted a review \\nof the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal \\ncontrol systems on behalf of the Board. The Committee’s review \\nof the effectiveness of internal controls has encompassed a \\nreview of various reports provided by management, Group Control \\nand Compliance, Group Risk, Group Audit and External Audit. \\nAnnually, the Committee reviews the Group treasury policy which \\ncontains a framework and approach to managing treasury risks. \\nThe Committee also receives risk management updates from \\nvarious areas of the business including pensions and Tesco Bank. \\nFurther information on the risk management process undertaken \\nis included on page 38. Specifically for internal controls over \\nfinancial reporting, a key financial controls framework is maintained \\nand used as the basis for focused second-line control activities. \\nThe results from this have been reported to the Committee \\nthrough the year. This key financial controls framework is currently \\nbeing enhanced to meet the future needs of pending corporate \\ngovernance reforms.\\nAudit and assurance policy (AAP)\\nIn line with the audit reform recommendations outlined in the \\nconsultation paper issued by the Department for Business \\nEnergy and Industrial Strategy, the Group is in the process of \\ndocumenting and implementing an audit and assurance policy. \\nGroup Risk & Audit is tasked with the responsibility for facilitating \\nthe development of the AAP, in coordination with other functions \\nacross the three lines of defence: management controls (first line), \\ntypically risk and compliance functions (second line) and Group \\nAudit (third line). The Committee will continue to monitor the \\ndevelopment of the AAP.External audit\\nAs the Group’s external auditor for the 2022/23 financial year, \\nDeloitte shared a further independent perspective on certain \\naspects of the Group’s financial control systems arising from its \\nwork and reported both to the Board and the Committee.\\nThe Committee regularly reviews the role of the external auditor \\nand the scope of its work. We will consider future audit needs as \\npart of the AAP. The Committee also considers the effectiveness \\nof the external auditor on an ongoing basis during the year. \\nAmong other factors, the review covers Deloitte’s independence, \\nobjectivity, appropriate mindset, and professional scepticism. \\nThe Committee’s conclusions are based on its own observations \\nand interactions with the external auditor and having regard to the \\nFRC’s ‘Revised Ethical Standard 2019’.\\nNon-audit services\\nThe FRC’s ‘Revised Ethical Standard 2019’ has reduced the areas \\nwhere the external auditor can provide non-audit services, such \\nthat only certain types of non-audit services that are closely \\nrelated to an audit or required by law or regulation can be \\nprovided. The Committee oversees the process for approving \\nall non-audit work provided by the external auditor to safeguard \\nthe objectivity and independence of the auditor and comply with \\nregulatory and ethical guidance. Where Deloitte has been chosen, \\nthey have demonstrated the relevant skills and experience making \\nthem an appropriate supplier to undertake the work in a cost-\\neffective and time-efficient manner, with appropriate \\nsafeguards in place.\\nOur policy for non-audit services is compliant with the FRC’s \\n‘Revised Ethical Standard 2019’.

The Committee discussed feedback from the previous \\nreview and improvements incorporated into the audit approach, \\nwhich included enhanced testing and reliance on internal controls, \\ngreater use of technology and data analytics, and continuous \\ninsights and improvements. The Committee recognised \\nimprovements in the provision of data driven insights and analysis \\nin connection with IFRS 16 lease liabilities and right of use assets \\nand revenue and cost of sales areas of the audit. In January 2023, \\nDeloitte’s effectiveness and quality was evaluated on the basis of \\nfeedback provided through questionnaires completed by the \\nBoard, management and business representatives. Facilitated by \\nan independent third party, the responses were collated and \\nDeloitte was rated effective. The Committee recommended to \\nthe Board that Deloitte be reappointed at the 2023 AGM. \\nThe effectiveness of Deloitte will be continually monitored in \\n2023/24 by the Committee.\\nDuring the year, Deloitte supported management in the continued \\nefforts to simplify the approach to impairment testing. These \\nimprovements reduced complexity, provided better identification \\nof impairment triggers and drove efficiencies in meeting \\naccounting standards. Internal training on the impairment \\nmodelling tool was provided to local finance teams, which led \\nto improved documentation and inputting. We also noted an \\nincreased central oversight and will continue to work with \\nmanagement to further simplify the process where possible. \\nOver the course of the year, the audit approach aligned with the \\nevolution of the Group’s control environment and business \\nstrategy. Deloitte provided data driven insights and analytics to \\nmanagement and the Committee, as part of their risk assessment \\nand testing of IT general controls, and in their review of IFRS 16 \\nlease balances and calculation of discount rates.\\nDeloitte was appointed at the AGM in June 2015 following the \\nconclusion of a formal tender process for the statutory audit \\ncontract and John Adam has been lead audit partner since 2020. The Company is in compliance with the requirements of The \\nStatutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation \\n(Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit \\nResponsibilities) Order 2014, which relates to the frequency and \\ngovernance of external audit tenders and the setting of a policy on \\nthe provision of non-audit services. The Committee reviews and \\nmakes a recommendation to the Board with regard to the \\nreappointment of the current external auditor each year. In \\nmaking this recommendation, the Committee monitored and \\nassessed their effectiveness, objectivity, independence, lead \\npartner rotation and any other factors that may impact the \\nCommittee’s judgement regarding the external auditor. The \\nCommittee monitored compliance with the Group’s policy on \\nthe employment of former Deloitte employees and concluded \\nthe auditors remained independent. Based on the performance \\nof the auditor and its knowledge of the business, the Committee \\nbelieves that it is in the best interests of shareholders to continue \\nto recommend Deloitte as the external auditor.

Tesco aims to be a place where \\ncolleagues can get on, as they wish, irrespective of their background. We are proud of our long history of helping colleagues develop \\ntheir careers in Tesco.\\nThe following principles guide our approach to reward:\\nHow we bring our principles to life\\nTesco provides colleagues across the Group with a competitive reward package. The Committee has responsibility for reviewing \\nremuneration and related policies for colleagues throughout the Group. This ensures we take into account the reward, incentives and \\nconditions available to colleagues when considering the remuneration of Executive Directors and senior management.\\nIn Tesco’s UK business in 2022/23, colleagues received a reward and benefits package in line with the elements set out in the table below. \\nThe purpose of each element is the same for all colleagues, creating a consistent cascade throughout the organisation.\\nWL1-3\\nExecutive Directors, Executive Committee and WL4-5 Other colleagues Hourly-paid colleagues in stores\\nBase salary Base salary supports the recruitment and retention of colleagues of the calibre, capability and experience needed to perform their \\nroles. Base salary provides fixed remuneration and reflects the size, scope and complexity of individual role responsibilities.\\nBenefits A market-competitive level of benefits for colleagues, enhancing the reward package and providing other reasons to work at Tesco, \\nsuch as discount in store.\\nPension The opportunity to save for retirement, with the employing company matching employee contributions.\\nAll-colleague \\nshare plans The opportunity to purchase shares in Tesco.\\nAnnual bonus The opportunity for colleagues to receive an annual bonus for delivering against business and \\nindividual goals. The opportunity gives colleagues a balance between fixed and variable pay \\nrelated to market practice based on role. \\nAt senior levels, a proportion of any bonus is deferred into Tesco shares to provide additional \\nalignment with shareholders’ experience. Our pay approach aims to provide \\nregular and predictable earnings \\nthrough competitive base pay for \\nour hourly-paid store colleagues. \\nWe agreed with our unions in 2019 \\nthat hourly-paid colleagues in stores \\nwould not receive an annual bonus, \\nreplacing it with a higher base rate \\nof pay. In distribution, colleagues \\nwho have transferred to the new \\n2022 contract no longer receive an \\nannual bonus, replaced with \\nenhanced rates of pay.\\nPerformance \\nShare  \\nPlanColleagues with responsibility for long-term Group \\nperformance are incentivised to achieve Tesco’s \\nstrategy and create sustainable shareholder value. \\nMeasures and targets for long-term incentive plans \\nare consistent for all participants and measured over \\na three-year period. \\nA two-year holding period after the vesting date also \\napplies at Executive Director level.\\nCorporate governance\\n89 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023', metadata={'source': 'pdf files/tesco.pdf', 'page': 90}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The balance between the different elements of remuneration \\ndepends largely on the role and seniority of colleagues. Junior \\ncolleagues’ remuneration is principally fixed pay, reflecting our \\nprinciple of helping to support a decent standard of living, where \\nregular pay levels help with personal budgeting and planning. \\nFor more senior colleagues, remuneration is weighted more \\ntowards variable pay, which can increase or decrease based on \\nthe performance they achieve against our goals. This approach \\nto pay design also reflects each individual’s ability to influence \\nTesco’s performance.\\nWhile the balance of the elements of remuneration may differ, \\nour consistent overall principle is that all colleagues should be \\npaid competitively against the relevant pay benchmark.\\nWe regularly ask colleagues across the Group how they feel \\nabout pay and benefits at Tesco. In our 2023 Every Voice Matters \\ncolleague survey, 63% of colleagues agreed that the total reward \\npackage at Tesco is competitive, which is well ahead of relevant \\nexternal benchmarks. In addition, 83% of colleagues said they \\nare able to work flexibly and 85% feel they can be themselves at \\nTesco, without fear of judgement. 66% of colleagues feel Tesco \\nsupports them with their financial wellbeing. Our colleagues are \\nthe heart of our business and Tesco remains committed to \\nbuilding an inclusive workplace where everyone can get on. \\nOur ongoing initiatives include:\\n –championing health and wellbeing to support our colleagues \\nin and out of work through a defined offer of mental, physical \\nand financial wellbeing;\\n –ensuring inclusivity in everything we do by embedding inclusive \\nbehaviours to build an inclusive workplace with a sense of \\nbelonging, led by inclusive leaders;\\n –equipping our colleagues with the skills they need to succeed \\nnow and in the future through various skills and career \\nprogrammes; and\\n –developing the next generation of talent through programmes \\nfor interns, apprentices and graduates.\\nColleague engagement \\nEngaging with colleagues and understanding their views is vital \\nto the Committee and its decision making. During the year, six \\nColleague Contribution Panels (CCPs) were held. They provide an \\nopportunity to seek the views of colleagues from across the Group \\non areas of specific interest to the Board, its Committees and our \\ncolleagues. They also allow colleagues to gain an understanding of \\nthe role and responsibilities of the Board and its Committees and \\nprovide colleagues with the opportunity to ask any questions. We \\nset out further details of the CCPs on page 63.\\nDuring the year, the Committee reviewed the pay, policies, \\nincentives and demographics of the wider workforce across the \\nGroup and the findings from the Every Voice Matters colleague \\nsurvey. During 2022 a Group-wide review of benefits was \\nundertaken to determine what colleagues value most in their \\nreward package and where improvement can be made.In addition, Directors regularly visit stores, distribution centres, \\ncustomer engagement centres and offices to meet with colleagues \\nto gauge their overall opinions and assess our culture.\\nWe use the information provided by colleagues to guide our \\napproach to Executive Director and senior management \\nremuneration.\\nUnderstanding workforce arrangements\\nThe Committee believes it is important to understand how \\ncolleague pay and other key colleague metrics operate throughout \\nthe Group. The Committee therefore receives regular updates \\nthroughout the year on these metrics via the wider workforce \\ndashboard, which sets out a broad range of information, including:  \\n –a summary of colleague demographics;  \\n –results from our Every Voice Matters survey, including \\nsatisfaction with reward;\\n –colleague pay positioning split by location;\\n –a summary of UK store colleague hourly pay versus \\ncomparators, the National Minimum Wage and National \\nLiving Wage;  \\n –salary budgets by business;  \\n –incentive outcomes by business; and  \\n –CEO pay ratio and gender pay gap over multiple years.\\nThe Committee is therefore well positioned to take this context \\ninto account when setting the pay of Executive Directors.  \\nCaring for our colleagues – wider colleague reward \\ninterventions  \\nOur fantastic team of colleagues is at the heart of Tesco. Last year \\nwe reached an agreement with USDAW for a substantial increase \\nin UK base pay – by 5.8% to £10.10 for hourly-paid colleagues in our \\nstores and customer fulfilment centres (CFCs) effective July 2022. \\nWe also announced a one-off thank you payment of 1.25% of \\nannual earnings to hourly-paid store, CFC and customer-\\nengagement centre colleagues in the UK.\\nThis year the cost-of-living challenges faced by our customers and \\ncolleagues alike have been very much front of mind. Tesco is \\nproud to have worked relentlessly to keep the cost of the weekly \\nshop as affordable as possible for our customers, but we are also \\nmindful of the need to ensure our colleagues’ wellbeing and to \\nrecognise their tremendous efforts.\\nTherefore, we made further increases in the hourly rate for UK \\nstore colleagues to £10.30 in November 2022 and have recently \\nannounced a further increase to £11.02 effective from April 2023 \\nas set out in the illustration opposite. We have also provided \\ninvestments in colleague pay and benefits in our other UK \\nbusinesses, ROI and Central Europe.\\nPay is just one way in which we can support our colleagues and \\nwe have provided further cost-of-living support through our \\nenhanced benefits package, including offering greater in store \\ndiscounts to colleagues and wider financial wellbeing support.Directors’ remuneration report continued  \\nWider remuneration at Tesco continued\\n90 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023', metadata={'source': 'pdf files/tesco.pdf', 'page': 91}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='(a) Where there has been a change in Group Chief Executive in the year, we have included the remuneration of both Group Chief Executives. This impacts the years ending February 2015 \\nand February 2021.\\nRelationship between the pay of the Group Chief Executive and UK colleagues\\nTesco is a retail business with one of the UK’s largest workforces. We employ around 254,000 UK-based colleagues in our major subsidiary, \\nTesco Stores Limited. These are mostly in customer-facing roles in-store or in our distribution network. Given the workforce profile, all \\nthree of the Group Chief Executive pay ratio reference points compare our Group Chief Executive’s remuneration with that of colleagues in \\nmainly customer-facing roles. There is relatively little difference in the outcomes, as we show below. Whatever the Group Chief Executive \\npay ratio may be, Tesco will continue to invest in competitive pay for all colleagues.\\nThe following table shows the ratio between the consolidated STFR of the Group Chief Executive for 2022/23 and the lower, median and \\nupper-quartile pay of our UK colleagues. We also show for comparison the pay ratios for the four preceding years.\\nThe total full-time equivalent (FTE) pay and benefits for the relevant colleagues is based on the period from 6 February 2022 to 4 February \\n2023. The reporting regulations offer three calculation approaches for determining the pay ratio – Options A, B and C. We have chosen \\nOption C for all years, which we deem the most appropriate methodology for Tesco.\\nTotal pay ratio\\n2018/19 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23\\nRatio of CEO’s STFR\\n25th percentile 247:1 355:1 136:1 251:1 231:1\\n50th percentile 226:1 305:1 118:1 224:1 197:1\\n75th percentile 209:1 279:1 116:1 216:1 182:1\\nThe table below sets out the base salary, total pay and benefit details of the Group Chief Executive and UK colleagues who are at the 25th, \\n50th and 75th percentile. \\n2022/23\\nGroup Chief Executive’s base salary £1,372,781\\nGroup Chief Executive’s total pay and benefits £4,442,692\\nUK colleagues’ salary\\nColleague at 25th percentile £18,771\\nColleague at 50th percentile £20,163\\nColleague at 75th percentile £22,663\\nUK colleagues’ total pay and benefits\\nColleague at 25th percentile £19,196\\nColleague at 50th percentile £22,533\\nColleague at 75th percentile £24,374\\nAs more than half of Tesco’s colleagues work part-time, the exercise required to determine FTE is extensive and complex. Tesco decided to \\nuse Option C as we had completed comprehensive data collation and analysis of all relevant colleagues for the purpose of gender pay gap \\n(GPG) reporting. This enabled us to use additional pay data (including overtime, salary sacrifice values and employer pension contributions) to \\nensure the STFR reflects total pay made throughout the financial year. This approach minimised the differing definitions of pay for STFR and \\nGPG to enable us to select the ‘best equivalents’ of P25, P50 and P75. The only adjustments made to determine the pay and benefits of the \\ncolleagues identified as P25, P50 and P75 related to working hours, basing amounts on a 36.5-hour working week. We believe the ‘best \\nequivalent’ colleagues identified are reasonably representative of the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles as Tesco has compiled pay on an \\nFTE basis. We reviewed pay across a sample of employees at each percentile before selecting the employee who was most representative.01,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,0007,000\\n02/2023 02/2022 02/2021 02/2020 02/2019 02/2018 02/2017 02/2016 02/2015 02/2014 02/20130153045607590105120CEO Single total figure of \\nremuneration  (£’000)Value of £100 invested \\non 25 February 2013 \\nCEO Single total figure of remuneration  Tesco share priceGroup Chief Executive remuneration compared to Tesco’s share price movement\\nThe graph below sets out the Group Chief Executive’s Single total figure of remuneration (STFR) compared to Tesco’s share price, rebased to \\n£100 at 25 February 2013.\\nCorporate governance\\n95 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023', metadata={'source': 'pdf files/tesco.pdf', 'page': 96}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In the case of the Group Chief Executive, his total remuneration comprises a significant proportion of variable pay. The Single total figure \\ntherefore varies considerably depending on the level of performance against the measures driving the annual bonus and PSP. In 2022/23, \\nthe annual bonus paid out at 79.1% of maximum compared with 95% in 2021/22, which has resulted in a fall in the Group Chief Executive’s \\npay ratio numbers this year. Since 2014, the median pay ratio has fluctuated, increasing and decreasing in alternate years in line with \\nvariable pay outcomes.\\nAs we set out on pages 89 and 91, we base our reward framework across the Group on a consistent set of principles for all: that \\noverall remuneration should be competitive when compared to similar roles in other organisations with which we compete for talent. \\nWe therefore determine colleague pay using the same principles as the pay for our Executive Directors. On this basis, we believe the \\nmedian ratio is consistent with the Company’s wider policies on employee reward, pay and progression.\\nGender pay\\nFor our 2021/22 report both our median and mean GPGs have increased slightly as we adapted to the post COVID-19 environment.  \\nOur median GPG has increased to 6.9%, less than half the UK national average of 14.9%. Our median bonus gap has increased to 30.5%.\\nOur GPG is attributable to two key factors. The first is having a higher number of male colleagues in our more senior roles. We are committed \\nto increasing the percentage of female colleagues in such roles to ensure our leadership team truly reflects our customer base and wider \\ncolleague population. We will continue to drive female representation across all roles to close the gap. The other factor is that we have more \\nmale colleagues than female colleagues who work shifts that pay premiums on Sundays, nights and bank holidays across our stores and \\ndistribution centres. If we remove premium payments from the calculation, our median pay gap reduces significantly, to 2.7%.\\nWe have included a stretching diversity and inclusion measure in the PSP for 2023 to ensure we continue to build a workplace where \\neveryone is welcome and our workforce represents the communities we serve.\\nSee our Everyone’s Welcome Report for more information at  \\nwww.tescoplc.com/media/759669/tesco-everyones-welcome-report-2022\\nRelative importance of spend on pay\\nThe chart below indicates how the pay of Executive Directors compares with other financial dispersals.

In respect of those \\nliabilities for which Directors may not be indemnified, the \\nCompany maintained a Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance \\npolicy throughout the financial year.\\nEmployment policies \\nWe have continued to focus on ensuring that our employment \\npolicies are simple, helpful and trusted, so that our colleagues \\nand managers are able to source the information they need \\nquickly and easily. \\nWe have continued to work with USDAW, our recognised trade \\nunion in the UK, to improve our policies so that they address the \\nneeds of all our colleagues. These include launching our new \\nperformance improvement policy, helping managers and \\ncolleagues understand what performance is, how we measure \\nit and the clear and simple process we follow to support \\ncolleagues to reach their expected level of performance. \\nWe also launched a new colleague contract in our stores and \\ncustomer fulfilment centres. Our colleagues will now have a set \\nnumber of contracted hours which will be scheduled within their \\navailability windows at least three weeks in advance of them \\nworking. Colleagues will have a primary department where they \\nwill be scheduled to work the majority of their shifts but may be \\nscheduled to work in other areas for some of their working hours. \\nThis enables colleagues to be flexible with picking up extra hours \\nand being fully trained across all areas of the store, leading to \\nmore interesting and varied jobs. Our local and national colleague forums continue to give \\ncolleagues a voice in how the business is run. Such feedback \\nhelps us drive our business forward, as our colleagues are closest \\nto our customers. To supplement these forums, we have also \\ncontinued our Colleague Contribution Panels. These give our \\ncolleagues the opportunity to share their views directly with a \\nNon-executive Director, who then relays them to the Board for \\ndiscussion and action. \\nOur equal opportunities, diversity and inclusion policies support \\nmanagers and colleagues in creating a diverse and inclusive \\nculture where everyone is welcome. Our policies demonstrate \\nour commitment to providing equal opportunities to all colleagues, \\nirrespective of age, disability (including colleagues who may have \\nbecome disabled during service), gender reassignment, marriage \\nand civil partnership, pregnancy or maternity, race, religion or \\nbelief, sex or sexual orientation. This year we recognised \\nmenopause-related absence, ensuring this type of absence \\nwould not be included within absence review levels. This ensures \\nwe are supporting our colleagues during this stage, through \\nfriendly and supportive wellbeing conversations.\\nOur aim is to attract and retain a diverse range of applicants from \\nall different backgrounds. All of our applicants and colleagues are \\ntreated fairly and we have a zero-tolerance approach, not only to \\nharassment, but also to discrimination and bullying of any kind. \\nThis includes an expectation that our recruitment systems are \\naccessible and managers give full and fair consideration to \\ncolleagues who have disabilities during recruitment and \\nsubsequently throughout their career with Tesco, including \\ncolleagues who may become disabled during their employment, \\nwhere every endeavour will be made to retain colleagues through \\nworkplace adjustments.\\nWe are also a proud Disability Confident Employer (Level 2) offering \\nvarious activities and programmes to attract, develop and retain \\ntalented disabled colleagues. Our colleague network for people \\nwith disabilities provides support by connecting them with people \\nwho have similar interests and backgrounds and helps them reach \\ntheir full potential. Through action-oriented colleague learning, we \\nare focused on raising awareness of the importance of inclusion \\nand developing a greater understanding of individual and collective \\nresponsibility. Supporting our commitment to change, targeted \\nlearning has been created for all colleagues, as well as specific \\nmodules for line managers, People and Resourcing teams, and our \\nleadership teams. \\nOur colleague networks (Armed Forces, Disability, LGBTQ+, \\nParents & Carers, Race & Ethnicity and Women at Tesco) \\nprovide support in creating a diverse and inclusive culture \\nwhere everyone is welcome. \\nWe actively encourage colleagues to take an interest in the \\nfinancial performance of our business through bonus plans for \\nspecific populations.

       " Document(page_content='Compliance with the Groceries (Supply \\nChain Practices) Market Investigation Order \\n2009 and the Groceries Supply Code of \\nPractice (the Code)\\nThe Code regulates aspects of the commercial relationship \\nbetween 14 designated grocery retailers in the UK and their \\nsuppliers of grocery products. The aim of the Code is to establish \\nand embed the overarching principles of fairness and lawfulness \\nwithin retailer/supplier relationships. Specific supplier protections \\nunder the Code include the obligation for agreements to be in \\nwriting and copies retained; reasonable notice to be given of \\nchanges to the supply chain or reduction in the volume of \\npurchases; and a number of provisions relating to payments to \\nsuppliers, including obligations for retailers to pay suppliers in \\nfull and without delay.\\nRetailer compliance with the Code is overseen by the Groceries \\nCode Adjudicator (GCA), Mark White. In 2022/23, we continued \\nto engage constructively with Mark White and were delighted for \\nthe opportunity to have our Chief Product Officer speak at the \\nAnnual GCA Conference in September 2022. \\nIn the reporting year, we have continued to develop and expand \\nour Code compliance programme. This year, we launched our \\nrefreshed new starter training module, which was assigned to all \\nour Food buying teams in July 2022 as an addition to the annual \\nmicro-learning refresher training campaign that all Product teams \\ncompleted. We also organised two GSCOP training sessions for the \\nlegal team and the relevant sales teams at dunnhumby to ensure \\nthere is understanding and awareness of the GSCOP principles \\nwhich we expect the dunnhumby sales teams to apply. We \\nconducted a deep dive into forensic auditing, assessing our \\ninternal process against the GCA’s best practice statement on \\nforensic auditing and implementing a small number of process \\nimprovements. Due to high inflation caused in part by post-\\npandemic recovery and the war in the Ukraine, requests for cost \\nprice increases (RFCPI) were a sensitive topic throughout the \\nreporting year. We ensured that our RFCPI processes are robust, \\nclear and in line with the GCA’s 7 Golden Rules by going to great \\nlengths to embed the process with our buying teams as well as \\nintroducing a new module in myProduct to record key data about \\nRFCPIs. Lastly, we were particularly pleased that in the GCA’s \\nannual supplier survey for 2022, 97% of our suppliers recognised \\nthat we comply ‘consistently well’ or ‘mostly well’ with the Code, \\nan improvement of 1%pt over the 2021 survey, ranking us third out \\nof 13 retailers. \\nIn our own Supplier Viewpoint survey, conducted in January 2023, \\nthe results continue to reflect the progress we have made with \\nour supplier relationships. Our total Group and UK scores for \\nsuppliers rating their satisfaction with Tesco as either ‘extremely \\nsatisfied’ or ‘very satisfied’ exceeded our targets. Compared with \\nthe same period last year, our Group satisfaction score was 86.6% \\nand our UK satisfaction score was 87%. Both of these scores are \\nnot only an increase compared to last year, but our highest scores \\nto date and ahead of targets. Among topics relevant to the Code, \\nour strongest score in Viewpoint continues to be ‘Tesco pays \\npromptly (within policy terms)’ at 92.8%. 88% of suppliers agreed \\nthat ‘Tesco treats me fairly’. \\nAlso, in the 2022 independent, industry-wide Advantage survey \\nof retailers, we were pleased to be ranked first for overall \\nperformance for the seventh year running. During the preceding financial year, we provided mandatory \\nannual refresher training for all colleagues involved in buying \\ngroceries, including not only the buying teams but also a wider set \\nof colleagues including those working in our Quality and Supply \\nChain divisions. In total 804 colleagues completed GSCOP annual \\nrefresher training, with the majority being trained via role-based, \\nmicrolearning scenarios. 89% of colleagues said that they found \\nmicrolearning a better way to learn and retain training than a single \\nlonger training module. In addition to refresher training, 245 new \\nstarters completed new starter GSCOP training and with the small \\nexception of a couple of colleagues, all of those required to \\ncomplete the training did so within the 30-day requirement set \\ndown by the Code. In addition to computer-based training, we \\nhave also provided numerous face-to-face training sessions on \\nGSCOP, whether on a standalone basis or combined with another \\nelement of legal or regulatory education.\\nThis year, six Code-related issues were raised by suppliers, down \\nfrom 13 during 2021/22. In addition, one issue was carried over \\nfrom 2021/22.\\nThe majority of concerns raised by suppliers related to delisting \\ndecisions, but in almost all of these cases the suppliers were not \\nalleging a breach of GSCOP but were instead seeking to have the \\ndelisting decision reviewed (or elements of it, such as the number \\nof SKUs to be delisted or the duration of the notice period). One \\nformal dispute (as defined by Part 5, Article 11 of the GSCOP Order) \\nwas received during the year.\\nAt the end of the reporting period, we had resolved all but \\none of the issues that were raised during the preceding year, \\nfollowing further discussion between the buying team and the \\nrelevant supplier, or between our Code Compliance Officer \\nand the supplier. \\nGoing concern, longer-term prospects and \\nviability statement\\nThe Directors consider that the Group and the Company have \\nadequate resources to remain in operation for the foreseeable \\nfuture and have therefore continued to adopt the going concern \\nbasis in preparing the financial statements.

The statement \\ncovers the activities of Tesco PLC and certain UK subsidiaries and \\ndetails policies, processes and actions we have taken to ensure \\nthat slavery and human trafficking are not taking place in our \\nsupply chains or any part of our business. Tesco is dedicated to \\ntackling modern slavery both within our own operations and supply \\nchains, as well as the issue of forced labour more broadly. Modern \\nslavery is one of our four key human rights strategic priority areas, \\nin which we work to bring about change through our Improve, \\nTransform and Advocate model. \\nIn our supply chains and within our own business, our greatest \\nrisks of modern slavery exist where there is a reliance on \\ntemporary, seasonal, informal and lower-paid labour. Through \\nconsultation with external experts and Tesco’s in-house team \\nexpertise, our enhanced modern slavery strategy details our risk \\nareas based on regions, products, supply chains and known drivers \\nof risk. Based on the above criteria, and established knowledge, \\nwe have identified four priority areas: primary sites and end-to-\\nend poultry in Thailand and Malaysia; priority fisheries; UK and \\nCentral Europe own-operations; and UK seasonal produce.\\nOur approach to preventing, identifying and mitigating modern \\nslavery is based on the five factors that we believe are vital to \\nenabling an environment to eradicate modern slavery, which \\ninclude effective grievance mechanisms and remediation. We have \\na robust programme for identifying potential or actual modern \\nslavery concerns including regular SEDEX Members Ethical Trade \\nAudits (SMETA), training requirements for all primary suppliers and \\na network of 40 in-country specialists. Detailed examples of how we have remediated issues identified \\ncan be found within our Modern Slavery Statement and include the \\nreimbursement of identified recruitment fees. Recruitment fees \\nand debt bondage are recognised to have a causal factor in more \\nthan 50% of modern slavery cases globally. As such, we are \\nfocusing on responsible recruitment as a strategy to mitigate risk \\nat the source. We have implemented specific responsible \\nrecruitment policies for suppliers in Thailand and Malaysia, and are \\nworking with suppliers in the UK to embed best practice. \\nMore information on our statement can be found on our website \\nat www.tescoplc.com.\\nAnti-bribery matters\\nWe have a zero-tolerance approach to bribery. Our anti-bribery \\nprogramme operates across the Group. The programme is built \\naround a clear understanding of how and where bribery risks \\naffect our business and comprises key controls such as: policies \\n(anti-bribery, gifts and entertainment, conflicts of interest, \\ncharitable donations); procedures such as conducting due \\ndiligence on suppliers (in particular those who will engage public \\nofficials on our behalf); training colleagues on bribery risks every \\nyear; and ongoing assurance programmes to test that the controls \\nare functioning effectively.

Adjusting \\nitems are defined in Note 1 and include net pension \\nfinance income/(cost). For the purpose of our materiality \\ndetermination we have excluded them from adjusting \\nitems and therefore increased/(reduced) adjusted profit \\nbefore tax accordingly. Our determined materiality \\nrepresents 0.15% (2021/22: 0.16%) of the Group’s revenue \\nfrom continuing operations and 0.8% (2021/22: 0.6%) of \\nnet assets.\\nRefer to Note 4 (Adjusting items) for further details of \\nadjusting items and management’s reconciliation of this \\nalternative performance measure to the Group’s \\nstatutory measure.

An overview of the scope of our audit\\n7.1 Identification and scoping of components\\nOur Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the \\nGroup and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and \\nassessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. \\nThe Group has subsidiary grocery retail operations in five \\ncountries, together with interests in a number of other businesses \\nboth in the UK and internationally.\\nThe Group’s accounting process is structured around business \\nunits managed by local finance functions and further supported by \\nshared service centres in Bengaluru, India and Budapest, Hungary \\nwhich provide accounting and administrative support for the \\nGroup’s core retail operations. Each local finance function reports \\nthrough to the central Group finance function based at the \\nGroup’s head office.\\nBased on our assessment of the Group, we focused our Group \\naudit scope primarily on the audit work on six significant retail \\nlocations (UK, Booker, Republic of Ireland, Czech Republic, \\nHungary and Slovakia) and Tesco Bank. The operations in \\nCzech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia are managed as one \\ncombined business. All of these components performed a \\ndetailed scoping exercise to determine which individual entities \\nand account balances would be subject to full scope or \\nspecified scope audits, the latter being where only the key \\nfinancial statement account balances were included in scope. \\nFor entities and account balances not subject to full or specified \\naudit procedures we performed analytical review procedures \\nto confirm our conclusion that there was no significant risk of \\nmaterial misstatement in the residual population. The entities \\nwhich were either in full or specified audit scope in the current \\nyear represent 97% (2021/22: 96%) of revenue from continuing \\noperations, 93% (2021/22: 98%) of operating profit from \\ncontinuing operations and 96% (2021/22: 95%) of total assets.\\nIn addition, we have performed analytical review procedures for \\nthree other businesses (dunnhumby, Tesco Mobile and OneStop), \\nwhere the extent of our testing was based on our assessment of \\nthe risks of material misstatement and of the size of the Group’s \\noperations at these locations.\\nAs each of the local finance functions maintains separate financial \\nrecords, we have engaged component auditors from the Deloitte \\nmember firms in the UK, Republic of Ireland and Central Europe to \\nperform procedures at all the wholly-owned components under \\nour direction and supervision. This approach also allows us to \\nengage local auditors who have appropriate knowledge of local \\nregulations to perform the audit work, under a common Deloitte \\naudit approach.Full audit scope 97%\\nSpecified audit procedures 0%\\nResidual scope 3%Revenue from continuing operations\\nFull audit scope 93%\\nSpecified audit procedures 0%\\nResidual scope 7%\\nFull audit scope 85%\\nSpecified audit procedures 11%\\nResidual scope 4%Profit before tax from continuing operations\\nTotal assets\\nAt the Group level we also tested the consolidation process and \\ncarried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that \\nthere were no significant risks of material misstatement of the \\naggregated financial information of the remaining components \\nnot subject to full scope or specified scope audits. At a Group \\nlevel we also performed audit procedures on centrally held \\nbalances including treasury, post-employment benefit \\nobligations, head office costs and litigation and claims.\\nThe most significant component of the Group is its retail business \\nin the UK. As such, there is extensive interaction between the \\nGroup and the UK audit team to allow appropriate level of \\ndirection and supervision in this audit work.

These are largely \\nconsistent across the retail business, however, Tesco Bank has \\nseparate information systems due to the nature of the business. \\nFor all of the components that were subject to full scope audits, \\nwe obtained an understanding of the relevant IT systems for the \\npurpose of our audit work.\\nIn previous years we reported deficiencies in certain IT controls. \\nAs described in the Audit Committee Report on page 73, \\nmanagement has implemented a remediation plan, progress \\nagainst which is monitored. Accordingly, consistent with the prior \\nyear, we extended the scope of our substantive audit procedures \\nin response to the identified deficiencies. \\nFurther details are set out in the ‘Retail technology environment, \\nincluding IT security’ key audit matter in section 5.6 above.\\n7.3 Our consideration of climate-related risks\\nThe Group is exposed to the impacts of climate change on its \\nbusiness and operations as highlighted in the Task Force on \\nClimate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report on page 20, \\nviability statement on page 46, the principal risks on page 38, and \\nin Note 14 of the financial statements. \\nWe have engaged with both the central finance and sustainability \\nfunctions to gain an understanding of the assessment of, and the \\nprocess undertaken to both identify and quantify, the Group’s \\nclimate-related risks. We have engaged our climate specialists \\nin our assessment to consider broader industry and  \\nmarket-wide practice. \\nWe completed an independent climate-based risk assessment in \\norder to consider the potential impact of climate change on the \\nGroup’s financial statements, incorporating both business specific \\nknowledge and wider industry awareness, including the extent to \\nwhich they have been included in the Group’s forecast financial \\ninformation. We used this to assess the completeness of the \\nGroup’s identified risks and to develop audit procedures to \\nrespond to these risks, in particular as part of our work in relation \\nto store impairment and long-term viability, as well as considering \\nclimate-related risks throughout our risk assessments on each \\nfinancial statement account balance. Further details of our work in \\nrelation to store impairment are set out in the ‘Store impairment \\nreview’ key audit matter in section 5.1 above. \\nIn considering the disclosures presented as part of the Strategic \\nReport, we engaged our climate specialists to assess compliance \\nwith the TCFD requirements and the recommendations made by \\nboth the Task Force and FRC as set out in their thematic reviews. \\nWe have also assessed whether these disclosures reflect our \\nunderstanding of the Group’s approach to climate.7.4 Working with other auditors\\nThe Group audit team issued detailed instructions to the \\ncomponent auditors and visited the component auditors for \\neach of the six significant locations set out above, in addition to \\nTesco Bank and the Group’s shared service centre in Bengaluru. \\nWe had a dedicated audit partner focused on overseeing the role \\nof the component audit teams, ensuring we applied a consistent \\naudit approach to the operations in the Group’s UK and \\ninternational businesses.\\nThe audit visits by the Group audit team were timed to enable us \\nto be involved during the planning and risk assessment process in \\naddition to the execution of detailed audit procedures. During our \\nvisits we attended key meetings with component management and \\nauditors and reviewed and challenged detailed component auditor \\nworking papers in the underlying audit files and component \\nreporting. In addition we attended component audit closing calls \\nand other key meetings with management throughout the 2022/23 \\naudit process. \\nAdditionally, the component audit teams attended an all-day \\nplanning meeting in July 2022 and a two-day planning update \\nmeeting in November 2022 led by the Group audit team and held \\nprior to commencement of our detailed audit work. The purpose \\nof this planning meeting was to ensure a good level of \\nunderstanding of the Group’s businesses, its core strategy and a \\ndiscussion of the significant risks and workshops on our planned \\naudit approach. Group management also attended part of the \\nmeeting to support these planning activities.\\nThe Parent Company is located in the United Kingdom and audited \\ndirectly by the Group audit team.\\n8.

The extent to which our \\nprocedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, \\nis detailed below. \\n11.1 Identifying and assessing potential risks related to \\nirregularities\\nIn identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in \\nrespect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with \\nlaws and regulations, we considered the following:\\n –the nature of the industry and sector, control environment and \\nbusiness performance including the design of the Group’s \\nremuneration policies, key drivers for Directors’ remuneration, \\nbonus levels and performance targets;\\n –the Group’s own assessment of the risks that irregularities may \\noccur either as a result of fraud or error;\\n –results of our enquiries of management, the Internal Audit \\nfunction, the Group’s Security function, the Group’s Compliance \\nOfficer, the Group’s General Counsel and the Audit Committee \\nabout their own identification and assessment of the risks of \\nirregularities;\\n –any matters we identified having obtained and reviewed the \\nGroup’s documentation of their policies and procedures \\nrelating to:\\n –identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations \\nand whether they were aware of any instances of non-\\ncompliance;\\n –detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether \\nthey have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;\\n –the internal controls established to mitigate risks of fraud or \\nnon-compliance with laws and regulations including the \\nGroup’s controls relating to the Group’s ongoing compliance \\nwith the GSCOP requirements and the requirements of the \\nUnited Kingdom’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and \\nFinancial Conduct Authority (FCA) in relation to Tesco Bank; and –the matters discussed among the audit engagement team \\nincluding significant component audit teams and relevant \\ninternal specialists, including IT, tax, valuations and pensions \\nactuarial specialists, and industry specialists regarding how and \\nwhere fraud might occur in the financial statements and any \\npotential indicators of fraud.\\nAs a result of these procedures, we considered the opportunities \\nand incentives that may exist within the organisation for fraud and \\nidentified the greatest potential for fraud in the following areas: \\nTesco Bank loan impairment and recognition of commercial \\nincome. In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also \\nrequired to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk \\nof management override.\\nWe also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory \\nframeworks that the Group operates in, focusing on provisions \\nof those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the \\ndetermination of material amounts and disclosures in the \\nfinancial statements. The key laws and regulations we considered \\nin this context included the Group’s ongoing compliance with the \\nGSCOP, UK Companies Act, Listing Rules, pensions legislation and \\ntax legislation.\\nIn addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations \\nthat do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but \\ncompliance with which may be fundamental to the Group’s ability \\nto operate or to avoid a material penalty. These included the \\nrequirements of the United Kingdom’s PRA, FCA and Solvency II in \\nrelation to Tesco Bank, employment law, health and safety and \\nfood safety laws and regulations. \\n11.2 Audit response to risks identified\\nAs a result of performing the above, we identified Tesco Bank loan \\nimpairment and recognition of commercial income as key audit \\nmatters related to the potential risk of fraud. The key audit \\nmatters section of our report explains the matters in more detail \\nand also describes the specific procedures we performed in \\nresponse to those key audit matters. \\nIn addition to the above, our procedures to respond to risks \\nidentified included the following:\\n –reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to \\nsupporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions \\nof relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct \\neffect on the financial statements;\\n –enquiring of management, the Audit Committee and in-house \\nexternal legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation \\nand claims;\\n –performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or \\nunexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material \\nmisstatement due to fraud;\\n –reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, \\nreviewing internal audit reports and reviewing correspondence, \\nif any, with HMRC and other relevant regulatory bodies; and\\n –in addressing the risk of fraud through management override \\nof controls, testing the appropriateness of journal entries and \\nother adjustments; assessing whether the judgements made \\nin making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential \\nbias; and evaluating the business rationale of any significant \\ntransactions that are unusual or outside the normal course \\nof business.\\nWe also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations \\nand potential fraud risks to all engagement team members \\nincluding internal specialists and significant component audit \\nteams, and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-\\ncompliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.Independent auditor’s report to the members of Tesco PLC continued\\n118 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023', metadata={'source': 'pdf files/tesco.pdf', 'page': 119}),\n",

Further information on  the Group’s strong \\nliquidity position is given in the Group review of  performance, \\nSummary of total indebtedness section, and information on \\ncommitted facilities is provided in Note 27. \\nUnless otherwise stated, the accounting policies set out below \\nhave been applied consistently to all periods presented in these \\nconsolidated Group financial statements. \\nNew standards, interpretations and amendments effective in the \\ncurrent financial year have not had a material impact on the \\nconsolidated Group financial statements.  \\nThe Group has not applied any standards, interpretations \\nor amendments that have been issued but are not yet effective.  \\nIFRS 17 ‘Insurance contracts’  will become effective in the \\nconsolidated Group financial statements for the financial year \\nending 24 February 2024. IFRS 17 will principally impact the Group’s \\nsubsidiary, Tesco Underwriting Limited (TU), which provides the \\ninsurance underwriting service fo r a number of the Group’s general \\ninsurance products. The simplified premium allocation approach will \\nbe applied to all material insurance groups issued and reinsurance \\ngroups purchased subsequent to the acquisition of TU in May 2021. \\nFor contract groups issued prior to the acquisition date, the general \\nmodel will be applied to the associated acquired claims liabilities. \\nThe presentation of some of the line items in the balance sheet and \\nincome statement may also change as a result of IFRS 17 adoption. \\nThe Group will adopt IFRS 17 retr ospectively and comparatives will \\nbe restated from a transition date of 27 February 2022, with an \\nimmaterial transition adjustment to the opening equity balance \\nat that date. \\nThe impact of the following is still under assessment: \\n– IFRS 16 amendments ‘Lease liability in a sale and leaseback’, \\nwhich will become effective in the consolidated Group financial \\nstatements for the financial year ending 22 February 2025, subject \\nto UK endorsement. \\nOther standards, interpretations and amendments issued but not \\nyet effective are not expected to have a material impact on the \\nconsolidated Group financial statements. Basis of consolidation \\nThe consolidated Group financial statements consist of the financial \\nstatements of the ultimate Parent Company (Tesco PLC), all entities \\ncontrolled by the Company (its subsidiaries) and the Group’s share \\nof its interests in joint ventures and associates. \\nThe financial year represents the 52 weeks ended 25 February 2023 \\n(prior financial year 52 weeks ended 26 February 2022). For the UK \\nand the Republic of Ireland (UK & ROI), the results are for the 52 \\nweeks ended 25 February 2023 (prior financial year 52 weeks ended \\n26 February 2022). For all other operations, the results are for the \\ncalendar year ended 28 February 2023 (prior calendar year ended \\n28 February 2022). \\nSubsidiaries \\nSubsidiaries are consolidated in the Group’s financial \\nstatements  from the date that cont rol commences until the \\ndate that control ceases. \\nIntragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income \\nand expenses arising fr om intragroup transactions are eliminated in  \\npreparing the consolidated financial statements. \\nJoint ventures and associates \\nThe Group’s share of the results of joint ventures and associates \\nis included in the Group income statement and Group statement \\nof comprehensive income/(loss) using the equity method of \\naccounting. Investments in joint ventures and associates are carried \\nin the Group balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes \\nin the Group’s share of the net assets of the entity, less any \\nimpairment in value. The carrying values of investments in joint \\nventures and associates include ac quired goodwill. If the Group’s \\nshare of losses in a joint venture or associate equals or exceeds its \\ninvestment in the joint venture or associate, the Group does not \\nrecognise further losses, unless it  has incurred obligations to do \\nso or made payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate. \\nDividends received from joint ventures or associates with nil \\ncarrying  value are recognised in the Group income statement as \\npart  of the Group’s share of post-tax profits/(losses) of joint \\nventures and associates. \\nUnrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures and \\nassociates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest \\nin the entity. \\nRevenue \\nRevenue is income arising from the sale of goods and services in \\nthe ordinary course of the Group’s activities, net of value added \\ntaxes. Revenue is recognised when performance obligations are \\nsatisfied and control has transferred to the customer. For the \\nmajority of revenue streams, there is a low level of judgement \\napplied in determining the transaction price or the timing of \\ntransfer  of control. \\nSale of goods \\nThe sale of goods represents the vast majority of the Group’s \\nrevenue. For goods sold in store, revenue is recognised at the point \\nof sale. For online or wholesale sales of goods, revenue is recognised \\non collection by, or delivery to, the customer. Revenue is reduced by \\na provision for expected returns (refund liability). An asset and \\ncorresponding adjustment to cost of sales is recognised for the \\nGroup’s right to recover goods from customers. \\nClubcard (customer loyalty programme) \\nClubcard points issued by Tesco when a customer purchases goods \\nare a separate performance obligation providing a material right to \\na future discount. The total transaction price (sales price of goods) \\nis allocated to the Clubcard points and the goods sold based on \\ntheir  relative standalone selling prices, with the Clubcard points \\nstandalone price based on the value of the points to the customer, \\nadjusted for expected redemption rates (breakage). The amount \\nallocated to Clubcard points is deferred as a contract liability \\nwithin  trade and other payables.  \\nFinancial statements\\n125 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023', metadata={'source': 'pdf files/tesco.pdf', 'page': 126}),\n",

Interest income is calculated on the \\ngross carrying amount of a financial asset unless the financial asset \\nis impaired, in which case interest income is calculated on the \\namortised cost, after allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs). \\nThe majority of the fees in re spect of services (credit card \\ninterchange fees, late payment and ATM revenue) are recognised at \\nthe point in time at which the transaction with the customer takes \\nplace and the service is performed. For services performed over \\ntime, payment is generally due monthly in line with the satisfaction \\nof performance obligations. \\nRefer to the Insurance section below for insurance revenue. \\nCommercial income \\nConsistent with standard industry practice, the Group has \\nagreements with suppliers whereby volume-related allowances, \\npromotional and marketing allowances and various other fees and \\ndiscounts are received in connection with the purchase of goods for \\nresale from those suppliers. Most  of the income received from \\nsuppliers relates to adjustments to a core cost price of a product, \\nand as such is considered part of the purchase price for that \\nproduct. Sometimes receipt of the income is conditional on the \\nGroup performing specified actions or satisfying certain \\nperformance conditions associated with the purchase of the \\nproduct. These include achieving agreed purchases or sales volume  \\ntargets and providing promotional or marketing materials and \\nactivities or promotional product positioning. While there is no  \\nstandard industry definition, these amounts receivable from \\nsuppliers in connection with the purchase of goods for resale are \\ngenerally termed commercial income. \\nCommercial income is recognised when earned by the Group, which \\noccurs when all obligations conditio nal for earning income have been \\ndischarged, and the income can be measured reliably based on the \\nterms of the contract. The in come is recognised as a  credit within \\ncost of sales. Where the income earned relates to inventories which \\nare held by the Group at the reporting date, the income is included \\nwithin the cost of those inventories, and recognised in cost of sales \\nupon sale of those inventories. \\nAmounts due relating to commercia l income are recognised within \\ntrade and other receivables, except in cases where the Group \\ncurrently has a legally enforceable right of set-off and intends to \\noffset amounts due from suppliers against amounts owed to those \\nsuppliers, in which case only the net amount receivable or payable is \\nrecognised. Accrued commercial in come is recognised within \\naccrued income when commercial  income earned has not been \\ninvoiced at the reporting date. \\nFinance income \\nFinance income, excluding income arising from financial services, is  \\nrecognised in the period to which it relates using the effective \\ninterest rate method. Finance costs \\nBorrowing costs are recognised in the Group income statement in \\nfinance costs, excluding those arisin g from financial services, in the \\nperiod in which they occur. For Tesco Bank, finance cost on financial \\nliabilities is determined using the effective interest rate method and \\nis recognised in cost of sales.  \\nBusiness combinations and goodwill \\nThe Group accounts for all business combinations by applying the \\nacquisition method. All acquisition-related costs are expensed. \\nOn acquisition, the assets (including intangible assets), liabilities and  \\ncontingent liabilities of an acquired  entity are measured at their fair \\nvalues. Non-controlling interests are stated at the non-controlling \\ninterests’ proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities \\nrecognised. \\nGoodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the \\nconsideration transferred over the net fair value of the Group’s \\nshare of the net assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the \\nacquired subsidiary, joint venture or associate and the fair value of  \\nthe non-controlling interest in the acquiree. If the consideration is \\nless than the fair value of the Group’s share of the net assets, \\nliabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity (i.e. a bargain \\npurchase), the difference is credited to the Group income statement \\nin the period of acquisition. \\nAt the acquisition date of a subsidiary, goodwill acquired is \\nrecognised as an asset and is allocated to each of the cash-\\ngenerating units or groups of cash-generating units expected to \\nbenefit from the business combination’s synergies and to the lowest \\nlevel at which management monitors  the goodwill. Goodwill arising \\non the acquisition of joint ventures and associates is included within \\nthe carrying value of the investment. On disposal of a subsidiary, joint \\nventure or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included \\nin the determination of the profit or loss on disposal. \\nWhere the Group obtains control of a joint venture or associate, the \\nGroup’s previously held interest in the acquired entity is remeasured \\nto its acquisition date fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, \\nis recognised in the Group income statement. \\nCloud software licence agreements \\nLicence agreements to use cloud software are treated as service \\ncontracts and expensed in the Group income statement, unless \\nthe Group has both a contractual right to take possession of the \\nsoftware at any time without significant penalty, and the ability to run \\nthe software independently of the host vendor. In such cases, the \\nlicence agreement is capitalised as software within intangible assets. \\nCosts to configure or customise a cloud software licence are \\nexpensed alongside the related service contract in the Group \\nincome statement, unless they create a separately identifiable \\nresource controlled by the Group, in  which case they are capitalised. \\nIntangible assets  \\nIntangible assets, such as software, acquired customer relationships \\nand pharmacy licences, are measured initially at acquisition cost \\nor costs incurred to develop the asset. Intangible assets acquired in \\na business combination are recognised at fair value at the \\nacquisition  date. \\nFollowing initial recognition, intangible assets with finite useful lives \\nare carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated \\nimpairment losses. They are amortised on a straight-line basis over \\ntheir estimated useful lives of three to 10 years for software and up \\nto 10 years for customer relationships. Intangible assets with \\nindefinite useful lives, such as pharmacy licences, are not amortised \\nand are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. \\nResearch costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditure \\nincurred on an individual project is capitalised only if  specific \\ncriteria  are met. \\n126 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023', metadata={'source': 'pdf files/tesco.pdf', 'page': 127}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=' \\n  Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023 127 Financial statements \\nProperty, plant and equipment  \\nProperty, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated \\ndepreciation and any recognised impairment in value. Property, plant \\nand equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis to its residual \\nvalue over its anticipated useful economic life: \\n– freehold buildings – 10 to 40 years; and \\n– fixtures and fittings, office equipment and motor vehicles – three \\nto 20 years. \\nImpairment of non-financial assets \\nGoodwill is reviewed fo r impairment at least annually by assessing the \\nrecoverable amount of each ca sh-generating unit, or group of  cash-\\ngenerating units, to which the goodwill relates. For all other  non-\\nfinancial assets (including other intangible assets, property, plant \\nand equipment, right of use assets and investment property) the \\nGroup performs impairment testing where there are indicators of \\nimpairment. Where the asset does not generate cash flows that \\nare independent from other assets, the Group estimates the \\nrecoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the \\nasset belongs. \\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of \\ndisposal, and value in use. When the recoverable amount is less \\nthan the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised \\nimmediately in the Group income statement. \\nGoodwill impairments are not su bsequently reversed. Where an \\nimpairment loss on other non-financial assets subsequently \\nreverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) \\nis increased to the revised estimate of the recoverable amount, but \\nso that the increased carrying amount does not exceed  the carrying \\namount that would have been determined if no  impairment loss had \\nbeen recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior \\nyears. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately as \\na credit to the Group income statement. \\nInventories \\nInventories comprise goods and development properties held for \\nresale. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable \\nvalue using the weighted average cost basis. Directly attributable \\ncosts and incomes (including applicable commercial income) are \\nincluded in the cost  of inventories. \\nCash and cash equivalents \\nCash and cash equivalents in the Group balance sheet consist of  \\ncash at bank and on hand, credit and debit card receivables, demand \\ndeposits with banks and short-term highly liquid investments with an \\noriginal maturity of three months or less, for example short-term \\ndeposits, loans and advances to banks, commercial paper and \\ncertificates of deposit. Cash and cash equivalents in the Group cash \\nflow statement also include overdraf ts repayable on demand as they \\nform an integral part of the Group’s cash management. \\nNon-current assets held for sale and discontinued \\noperations  \\nNon-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held \\nfor sale when their carrying amount  is to be recovered principally \\nthrough a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. \\nThey are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less \\ncosts to sell. \\nThe net results of discontinued operations are presented separately \\nin the Group income statement (and the comparatives restated).  \\nLeases \\nThe Group assesses whether a contra ct is, or contains, a lease at \\ninception of the contract. A lease conveys the right to direct the use \\nand obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of an identified \\nasset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.  \\nThe Group as a lessee \\nA right of use asset and corresponding lease liability are recognised \\nat commencement of the lease.  The lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease \\npayments, discounted at the rate implicit in the lease, or if that \\ncannot be readily determined, at the lessee’s incremental borrowing \\nrate specific to the term, country, currency and start date of the \\nlease. Lease payments include: fixed payments; variable lease \\npayments dependent on an index or rate, initially measured using \\nthe index or rate at commencement; the exercise price under a \\npurchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise; \\npenalties for early termination if the lease term reflects the Group \\nexercising a break option; and payments in an optional renewal \\nperiod if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension \\noption or not exercise a break option. \\nThe lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost \\nusing the effective interest rate method. It is remeasured, with a \\ncorresponding adjustment to the right of use asset, when there is  a \\nchange in future lease payments re sulting from a rent review, change \\nin an index or rate such as inflation, or change in the Group’s \\nassessment of whether it is reasonably certain to exercise  a \\npurchase, extension or break option.  \\nThe right of use asset is initially measured at cost, comprising: the \\ninitial lease liability; any lease payments already made less any lease  \\nincentives received; initial direct costs; and any dilapidation or \\nrestoration costs. The right of use asset is subsequently depreciated \\non a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the \\nuseful life of the underlying asset. The right of use asset is tested \\nfor impairment if there are any indicators of impairment. \\nLeases of low value assets (value when new less than £5,000) \\nand short-term leases of 12 months or less are expensed to the \\nGroup income statement, as are variable payments dependent on \\nperformance or usage, ‘out of contract’ payments and non-lease \\nservice components. \\nThe Group as a lessor \\nLeases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the \\nlease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to \\nthe lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Where \\nthe Group is an intermediate lessor, the sublease classification is \\nassessed with reference to the head lease right of use asset. \\nAmounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as \\nreceivables at the amount of the Group’s net investment in the \\nlease. Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so \\nas to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the Group’s net \\ninvestment in the lease. Rental income from operating leases is \\nrecognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. \\nSale and leaseback \\nA sale and leaseback transaction is where the Group sells an asset \\nand immediately reacquires the use of the asset by entering into a \\nlease with the buyer. A sale occurs when control of the underlying \\nasset passes to the buyer. A lease liability is recognised, the \\nassociated property, plant and equipment asset is derecognised, and \\na right of use asset is recognised at the proportion of the carrying \\nvalue relating to the right retained. Any gain or loss arising relates to \\nthe rights transferred to the buyer.  \\nIn the Group cash flow statement, sale and leaseback proceeds \\nreceived are classified as investin g cash flows, unless the proceeds \\nexceed the fair value of the asset sold, in which case the excess \\nproceeds are classified as financing cash flows. \\nProperty buybacks \\nA property buyback is where a property that is currently leased is \\nbought back from the landlord. Property buybacks that are a direct \\npurchase of the underlying asset, outside of a corporate wrapper, \\nare viewed as the modification of the lease to include a purchase \\noption, followed by the immediate exercise of that purchase option. \\nThe lease liability is settled and the right of use asset forms part of \\nthe cost of the property, plant and equipment acquired, and no \\ngain  or loss is recognised in the Group income statement from the \\nproperty  buyback.  \\nFinancial statements\\n127 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023', metadata={'source': 'pdf files/tesco.pdf', 'page': 128}),\n",

The resulting cost is charged to the Group income statement \\nover the vesting period. The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect \\nexpected and actual levels of vesting. \\nTaxation \\nThe tax expense included in the Group income statement consists of \\ncurrent and deferred tax. \\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for \\nthe financial year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted \\nby the balance sheet date. Tax expense is recognised in the Group \\nincome statement except to the extent that it relates to items \\nrecognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income/(loss) \\nor directly in the Group statement of changes in equity, in  which \\ncase it is recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive \\nincome/(loss) or directly in the Group statement of  changes in \\nequity, respectively. \\nDeferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, \\nproviding for temporary differences between the carrying amounts \\nof assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the \\namounts used for taxation purposes. \\nDeferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply \\nin the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised based \\non the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by \\nthe balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the \\nGroup income statement, except when it relates to  items charged or \\ncredited directly to the Group statement of changes in equity or the \\nGroup statement of comprehensive income/(loss), in which case the \\ndeferred tax is also recognised in  equity, or other comprehensive \\nincome, respectively. \\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable \\nthat taxable profits will be available against which deductible \\ntemporary differences can be utilised. \\n The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each \\nbalance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer \\nprobable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or \\npart of the assets to be recovered. \\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when \\nthere is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets \\nagainst current tax liabilities and they relate to income taxes levied by \\nthe same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or \\ndifferent taxable entities which intend to settle current tax assets \\nand liabilities on a net basis. \\nTax provisions are recognised fo r uncertain tax po sitions where a  risk \\nof an additional tax liability has been identified and it is probable that \\nthe Group will be required to settle that tax. Measurement is \\ndependent on management’s expectation of the  outcome of \\ndecisions by tax authorities in the various tax jurisdictions in which \\nthe Group operates. This is assessed on a case-by-case basis using \\nin-house tax experts, professional firms and previous experience. \\nRefer to Note 6. \\nForeign currencies \\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds \\nSterling, which is the ultimate Parent Company’s functional currency. \\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional \\ncurrency at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction.  \\nAt each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are  \\ndenominated in foreign currencies are retranslated to the functional \\ncurrency at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange \\ndifferences are recognised in the Group income statement in the \\nperiod in which they arise, apar t from exchange differences on \\ntransactions entered into to hedg e certain foreign currency risks, \\nand exchange differences on moneta ry items forming part of the net \\ninvestment in a foreign operation. \\nThe assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are \\ntranslated into Pounds Sterling at  exchange rates prevailing at the \\nbalance sheet date. Profits and losses are translated at average \\nexchange rates for the relevant  accounting periods. Exchange \\ndifferences arising are recognised in the Group statement of \\ncomprehensive income/(loss) and are included in the Group’s \\ntranslation reserve. Such transl ation differences are recognised \\nas income or expenses in the period in which the operation is \\ndisposed of. \\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a \\nforeign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity \\nand translated at the closing rate.  \\nFinancial instruments \\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group \\nbalance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual \\nprovisions of the instrument. Financial assets are classified as either \\nfair value through profit or loss, fair value through other \\ncomprehensive income, or amortised cost. Classification and \\nsubsequent remeasurement depends on the Group’s business \\nmodel for managing the financial asset and its cash flow \\ncharacteristics. Financial assets that are held for collection of \\ncontractual cash flows, where those cash flows represent solely \\npayments of principal and interest , are measured at amortised cost. \\nAll other financial assets are measured at fair value. \\nTrade receivables \\nTrade receivables are non interest-bearing and are recognised \\ninitially at fair value, or at transact ion price if there is not a significant \\nfinancing component. They are subsequently held at amortised cost \\nusing the effective interest rate method, less allowance for ECLs. \\nInvestments \\nInvestments in debt instruments at amortised cost are measured at \\namortised cost, using the effective interest rate method less \\nallowance for ECLs.   \\n128 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023', metadata={'source': 'pdf files/tesco.pdf', 'page': 129}),\n",

Gains and losses \\narising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in other \\ncomprehensive income, and are not subsequently reclassified to  the \\nGroup income statement, including on derecognition. Impairment \\nlosses are not recognised separately from other changes in fair \\nvalue. Dividends are recognised in the Group income  statement \\nwhen the Group’s right to receive payment is  established. \\nProperty fund and other investments held at fair value through profit \\nor loss are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value \\nrecognised in the Group income statement. \\nShort-term investments \\nShort-term investments are liquid financial assets which have an \\noriginal maturity of 12 months or less. Short-term investments are \\ntypically readily available for conversion to cash, but do not meet the \\ncriteria for classification as cash  equivalents because either their \\nmaturity is greater than three months, for example short-term \\ndeposits, reverse repurchase ag reements, commercial paper and \\ncertificates of deposit, or the risk of changes in value is more than \\ninsignificant, for example money market funds. \\nLoans and advances to customers \\nLoans and advances are initially recognised at fair value plus directly \\nrelated transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these \\nassets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest \\nmethod less any allowance for ECLs. \\nImpairment of financial assets \\nThe Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the ECLs associated \\nwith its financial assets carried at amortised cost and fair value \\nthrough other comprehensive income. The ECLs are updated at \\neach reporting date to refl ect changes in credit risk. \\nThe three-stage model for impairment has been applied to loans and \\nadvances to customers, investments in debt instruments at \\namortised cost, investments in debt instruments at fair value \\nthrough other comprehensive income, short-term investments and \\nloan receivables from joint ventures and associates. The credit risk is \\ndetermined through modelling a range of possible outcomes for \\ndifferent loss scenarios, usin g reasonable and supportable \\ninformation about past events, current conditions and forecasts of \\nfuture events and economic conditions and taking into account the \\ntime value of money. A 12-month ECL is recognised, unless the credit \\nrisk on the financial asset increases significantly after initial \\nrecognition, when the lifetime ECL is recognised. The expected \\nlifetime of a financial asset is generally the contractual term. \\nFor trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables, the  \\nGroup applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9 ‘Financial \\ninstruments’, with lifetime ECLs recognised from initial recognition of \\nthe receivable. These assets are grouped, based on  shared credit \\nrisk characteristics and days past due, with ECLs  for each grouping \\ndetermined based on the Group’s historical  credit loss experience, \\nadjusted for factors specific to each receivable, general economic \\nconditions and expected chan ges in forecast conditions. \\nNo ECL is recognised for loans an d advances to banks due to the \\nshort-term nature of these balances, the frequency of origination \\nand settlement of balances and taking account of collateral held. \\n Interest-bearing borrowings \\nInterest-bearing bank loans and ov erdrafts are initially recorded at  \\nfair value, net of attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial \\nrecognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised \\ncost with any difference between proceeds and redemption value \\nbeing recognised in the Group income statement over the period of \\nthe borrowings on an effective interest basis. \\nTrade payables \\nTrade payables are non interest-bea ring and are recognised initially \\nat fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the \\neffective interest method. \\nEquity instruments \\nEquity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the \\nproceeds received, net of direct issue costs. \\nDerivative financial instruments and hedge accounting \\nThe Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its \\nexposure to foreign exchange, inflat ion, interest rate and commodity \\nrisks arising from operating, financing and investing activities. \\nThe Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments \\nfor trading purposes. \\nDerivative financial instruments are recognised and stated at fair \\nvalue. Where derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, any \\ngains or losses on remeasurement are immediately recognised in \\nthe Group income statement. Where derivatives qualify for hedge \\naccounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the \\nnature of the hedge relationship and the item being hedged. \\nAt inception of designated hedging relationships, the Group \\ndocuments the risk management objective and strategy for \\nundertaking the hedge, the nature of the risks being hedged and \\nthe economic relationship between the item being hedged and the  \\nhedging instrument, including whether the change in cash flows  of \\nthe hedged item and hedging instrument are expected to  offset \\neach  other. \\nAs permitted under IFRS 9, the Group has elected to continue \\nto apply the existing hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 \\n‘Financial  instruments: Recognition and measurement’ for its \\nportfolio hedge accounting until a new macro hedge accounting \\nstandard is implemented. \\nDerivative financial instruments wi th maturity dates of more than \\none year from the reporting date  are disclosed as non-current.  \\nFair value hedging \\nDerivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges \\nwhen they hedge the Group’s exposure to changes in the fair \\nvalue of a recognised asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of \\nderivatives that are designated as fair value hedges are recognised \\nin the Group income statement within finance income or costs, \\ntogether with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that \\nis attributable to the hedged risk.  \\nIf the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the  \\nadjustment to the carrying amount of  a hedged item is amortised to \\nthe Group income statement over the remaining period to maturity. \\nCash flow hedging \\nDerivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges \\nwhen they hedge the Group’s exposure to variability in cash flows \\nthat is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a \\nrecognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecasted \\ntransaction. The effective element of any gain or loss from \\nremeasuring the derivative designated as the hedging instrument \\nis recognised directly in other comprehensive income and \\naccumulated in the hedging reserve. Any cost of hedging, such as the \\nchange in fair value related to forward points and currency basis \\nadjustment, is separately accumulated in the cost of hedging \\nreserve. The ineffective element is recognised immediately in the \\nGroup income statement within finance income or costs. \\nFinancial statements\\n129 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023', metadata={'source': 'pdf files/tesco.pdf', 'page': 130}),\n",

For all other cash flow hedges, the amounts \\naccumulated in the hedging reserve and cost of hedging reserve are \\nrecognised in the Group income statement when the hedged item or \\ntransaction affects the Group income statement.  \\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument \\nexpires or is sold, terminated or exercised or no longer meets the \\nGroup’s risk management objective. The cumulative gain or loss in \\nthe hedging reserve and cost of hedging reserve re mains until the \\nforecast transaction occu rs or the original hedged item affects the \\nGroup income statement.  \\nIf a forecast hedged transaction is no longer expected  to occur, the \\ncumulative gain or loss in the hedging reserve and cost of hedging \\nreserve is reclassified to the Group income statement. \\nNet investment hedging \\nFinancial instruments are classified as net investment hedges when \\nthey hedge the Group’s net investment in an overseas operation. \\nThe effective element of any foreign exchange gain or loss from \\nremeasuring the instrument is recognised directly in other \\ncomprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve \\nin equity. Any ineffective element is recognised immediately in the \\nGroup income statement. Gains and losses accumulated in the \\ntranslation reserve are reclassified to the Group income statement \\nwhen the foreign operation is disposed of.  \\nOffsetting financial instruments \\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount \\nreported in the Group balance sheet when there is a current legally \\nenforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an \\nintention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the \\nliability simultaneously. \\nProvisions  \\nProvisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures \\nexpected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax \\ndiscount rate that reflects current  market assessments of the time \\nvalue of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase \\nin the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest \\nexpense. Provisions for onerous contracts are recognised when the \\nGroup believes that the unavoidable costs of meeting or exiting the \\ncontract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received \\nunder the contract.  \\nSupplier financing arrangements \\nSuppliers can choose whether to  access supplier financing \\narrangements, which are provided by different third-party banks \\nin different countries. Commercial requirements, including payment \\nterms or the price paid for goods, do not depend on whether a \\nsupplier chooses to access such arrangements. The arrangements \\nsupport the Group’s suppliers by giving them the option to \\naccess funding early, often  at a lower cost than they could \\nobtain  themselves. \\nUnder the arrangements, suppliers may choose to access payment \\nearly rather than on the Group’s normal payment terms, at a \\nfunding cost to the supplier that is set by the provider banks but \\nbased on Tesco’s credit risk and the appropriate country risk \\npremium. If  suppliers choose not to access early payment, the \\nprovider banks pay the suppliers on the Group’s normal payment \\nterms. The Group pays the provider banks on the Group’s normal \\npayment terms, regardless of whether the supplier has chosen to \\naccess funding early. \\nManagement reviews supplier financing arrangements to determine  \\nthe appropriate presentation of balances outstanding as  trade \\npayables or borrowings, dependent on the nature of each  \\narrangement. Factors considered in determining the appropriate presentation include the commercial rationale for the  arrangement, \\nimpact on the Group’s working capital positions, credit \\nenhancements or other benefits provided to the bank and \\nrecourse  exposures. \\nBalances outstanding under current supplier financing arrangements \\nare classified as trade payables, and cash flows are included in \\noperating cash flows, since the financing arrangements are agreed \\nbetween the supplier and the banks, and the Group does not provide \\nadditional credit enhancement nor obtain any working capital benefit \\nfrom the arrangements. Refer to Note 19. \\nInsurance  \\nPrior to the acquisition of TU on 4 May 2021, the Group generated \\ncommission from the sale and service of motor and home insurance \\npolicies underwritten by TU. Following the acquisition, these \\namounts represent intercompany transactions which are fully \\neliminated in the Group income statement. The Group also \\ngenerated commission from the sale and service of motor and home \\ninsurance policies underwritten by  a third-party underwriter until \\nAugust 2021, when the Group brought in-house the writing of home \\nand motor insurance policies which were previously underwritten \\nthrough its broker panel. Commission was based on commission \\nrates which were independent of the profitability of underlying \\ninsurance policies. Similar commission income is also generated from \\nthe sale of white  label insurance products underwritten by other \\nthird-party providers. This commission income is recognised on a \\nnet basis as such policies are sold. \\nIn the case of some commission income on insurance policies \\nmanaged and underwritten by a third party, the Group recognises \\ncommission income from policy rene wals as such policies are sold. \\nThis is when the Group has satisfied all of its performance obligations \\nin relation to the policy sold and it is considered highly probable that \\na significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognised will not \\noccur in future periods. This ca lculation takes into account both \\nestimates of future renewal volumes and renewal commission rates. \\nA contract asset is recognised in relation to this revenue. This is \\nunwound over the remainder of the contract with the customer, \\nin this case being the third-party insurance provider. \\nThe end policyholders have the right to cancel an insurance policy at \\nany time. Therefore, a contract liab ility is recognised for the amount \\nof any expected refunds due and th e revenue recognised in relation \\nto these sales is reduced accordingly. This contract refund liability is \\nestimated using prior experience of customer refunds. The \\nappropriateness of the assumptions used in this calculation is \\nreassessed at each reporting date. \\nClassification of insurance contracts \\nContracts under which the Group a ccepts significant insurance risk \\nfrom another party (the policyholder) by agreeing to compensate the \\npolicyholder or other beneficiary if a specified uncertain future event \\n(the insured event) adversely affects the policyholder or other \\nbeneficiary are classified as insu rance contracts. These contracts \\nremain insurance contracts until all rights and obligations are \\nextinguished or expire. Insurance contracts may also transfer \\nsome  financial risk. \\nInsurance income \\nGross written premiums comprise premiums on contracts entered \\ninto during the year, irrespective of whether they relate in whole or \\nin part to a later accounting pe riod, and exclude tax and levies. \\nThe earned portion of premiums wri tten is recognised as revenue. \\nPremiums are earned from the date of attachment of risk, over the \\nindemnity period, based on the pattern of risks underwritten. \\nInsurance claims \\nClaims and claims handling expens es are recognised as incurred, \\nbased on the estimated cost of settling all liabilities arising on events \\noccurring up to the balance sheet date. \\n130 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023', metadata={'source': 'pdf files/tesco.pdf', 'page': 131}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=' \\n  Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023 131 Financial statements \\nReinsurance \\nThe Group cedes reinsurance in the normal course of business for \\nthe purpose of limiting its net loss potential through the \\ndiversification of its risks. Reinsurance arrangements, including \\nquota share, excess of loss and adverse development cover \\ncontracts, do not relieve the Group from its direct obligations to its \\npolicyholders. Only contracts that give rise to a significant transfer of \\ninsurance risk are accounted for as  reinsurance contracts. Amounts \\nrecoverable under such contracts are generally recognised in the \\nsame year as the related claim. Contracts that do not transfer \\nsignificant insurance risk (i.e. financial reinsurance) are accounted \\nfor as financial instruments. \\nReinsurance assets include balances due from reinsurance \\ncompanies for reinsurance clai ms. Amounts recoverable from \\nreinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the \\noutstanding claims provision or settled claims associated with the \\nreinsured policy. The earned po rtion of reinsurance premiums \\n(insurance premium income ceded to reinsurers) is recognised as \\nreinsurance premium expense. The provision for unearned \\nreinsurance premiums comprise s the element of reinsurance \\npremiums relating to services to  be received in future years. \\nAmounts recoverable under reinsura nce contracts are assessed for \\nimpairment at each year-end date. Such assets are deemed \\nimpaired if there is objective evidence, as a result of an event that \\noccurred after initial recognition, that the Group may not recover all \\namounts due and that the event has a reliably measurable impact on \\nthe amounts that the Group will receive from the reinsurer. \\nProvision for outstanding claims \\nThe provision for outstanding claims represents the Group’s \\nestimate of the ultimate cost of settling all claims incurred but \\nunpaid at the reporting date whethe r reported or not, and related \\ninternal and external claims handling expenses. Claims outstanding \\nare assessed by reviewing individual claims data and making an \\nallowance for claims incurred but not yet reported, adjusted for the \\neffect of both internal and external foreseeable events, such as \\nchanges in claims handling procedures, inflation, judicial trends, \\nsubstantively enacted legislative changes and past experience and \\ntrends. Reinsurance and other recoveries are assessed in a manner \\nsimilar to the claims outstanding and presented separately as assets. \\nUnearned premium and unexpired risk provision \\nThe provision for unearned premiums comprises the proportion of \\ngross premiums written, which is estimated to be earned in the \\nfollowing or subsequent accounting  periods, calculated separately \\nfor each insurance contract us ing the daily pro rata method, \\nadjusted if necessary to reflect any variation in the incidence of risk \\nduring the period covered by th e contract. Where the value of \\nexpected claims and expenses attributable to unexpired periods of \\npolicies in force exceeds the unearned premium provision, a further \\nprovision is made, calculated by reference to classes of business \\nwhich are managed together. \\nAlternative performance measures (APMs) \\nIn the reporting of fina ncial information, the Directors have adopted \\nvarious APMs. Refer to the Glossary for a full list of the Group’s \\nAPMs, including comprehensive definitions, their purpose, \\nreconciliations to IFRS measures and details of any changes to APMs. \\nJudgements and sources of estimation uncertainty \\nThe preparation of the consolidated Group financial statements \\nrequires management to make judgements, estimates and \\nassumptions in applying the Group’s accounting policies to \\ndetermine the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and \\nexpenses. The estimates and associ ated assumptions are based on \\nhistorical experience and various other factors that are believed to \\nbe reasonable under the circumst ances. Actual results may differ \\nfrom these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are \\nreviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions to accounting estimates \\napplied prospectively. Critical accounting judgements \\nCritical judgements, apart from those involving estimations, that are \\napplied in the preparation of the consolidated Group financial \\nstatements are discussed below:  \\nLeases \\nManagement exercises judgement in determining the likelihood of  \\nexercising break or extension options in determining the lease term. \\nBreak and extension options are included to provide operational \\nflexibility should the economic outlook for an asset be different to \\nexpectations, and hence at commencement of the lease, break or \\nextension options are not typically considered reasonably certain to \\nbe exercised, unless there is a valid business reason otherwise.  \\nThe discount rate used to calculate the lease liability is the rate \\nimplicit in the lease, if it can be readily determined, or the lessee’s \\nincremental borrowing rate if not. Management uses the rate implicit \\nin the lease where the lessor is a related party (such as leases from \\njoint ventures) and the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate for all \\nother leases. Incremental borrowing rates are determined monthly \\nand depend on the term, country, currency and start date of the \\nlease. The incremental borrowing rate is determined based on a \\nseries of inputs includ ing: the risk-free rate  based on government \\nbond rates; a country-specific risk adjustment; a credit risk \\nadjustment based on Tesco bond yields; and an entity-specific \\nadjustment where the entity risk profile is different to that of \\nthe Group. \\nRefer to Note 12 for additional disclosures relating to leases. \\nJoint ventures and associates \\nThe Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements under \\nIFRS 11 ‘Joint arrangements’ and determined them to be joint \\nventures. These assessments required the exercise of judgement \\nas set out in Note 13. \\nAPMs – Adjusting items \\nAdjusting items relate to certain costs or incomes that derive from \\nevents or transactions that fall within the normal activities of the \\nGroup but which, individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate, \\nare excluded from the Group’s APMs by virtue of their size and \\nnature in order to provide a helpful alternative perspective of the \\nyear-on-year trends, performance and position of the Group’s \\ntrading business that is more comparable over time. This alternative \\nview is consistent with how management views the  business, and \\nhow it is reported internally  to the Board and Executive  Committee \\nfor performance analysis, planning , reporting, decision-making and \\nincentive-setting purposes.  \\nManagement exercises judgement in determining the adjustments to \\napply to IFRS measurements, and this assessment covers the nature \\nof the item, cause of occurrence and the scale of impact of that \\nitem on reported performance and individual financial statement \\nline items, as well as consistency with prior periods. Reversals of \\nprevious adjusting items are assessed based on the same criteria to \\nensure an even-handed treatment of gains and losses. The amount \\nand timing of adjusting items can be unpredictable and subject to a \\nhigher level of scrutiny by users of the accounts. Adjusting items can \\ninclude, but are not limited to: litigation costs; impairment charges \\nand reversals; property transactions  such as disposals; amortisation \\nof acquired intangibles; changes in uncertain tax positions; \\nrestructuring and redundancy costs; profits or losses on disposal \\nof businesses; net pension finance income/(costs); and fair value \\nremeasurements of financial instruments. The tax effect of such \\nitems is also classified as adjusting.  \\nThe Group income statement is presented in a columnar format \\nto enable users of the accounts to see the Group’s performance \\nbefore adjusting items, the adjusting items, and the statutory total \\non a line-by-line basis. An analysis of the adjusting items included in \\nthe Group income statement, together with the impact of these \\nitems on the Group cash flow statement, is disclosed in Note 4. \\nRefer to pages 207 to 212 for further details on the Group’s APMs. \\nFinancial statements\\n131 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023', metadata={'source': 'pdf files/tesco.pdf', 'page': 132}),\n",

Key  assumptions \\nand sensitivities for post-employment benefit obligations are \\ndisclosed in  Note 29. \\nImpairment of non-financial assets \\nThe Group evaluates goodwill and non-current assets for impairment \\nas set out in Note 14. The key assumptions and estimates to which \\nthe recoverable amounts are most sensitive, the methodology for \\ncalculating them and sensitivities are also disclosed in Note 14. \\nTesco Bank ECL measurement \\nThe measurement of ECLs for Tesco Bank financial assets requires \\nthe use of complex models and significant assumptions about future \\nmacroeconomic conditions and cr edit behaviour, such as the \\nlikelihood of customers defaulting and the resulting losses. \\nKey assumptions and sensitivities for Tesco Bank ECLs are \\ndisclosed  in Note 27. \\nOther significant estimates \\nOther estimates for which management believes there is a limited \\nrisk of a material change in the amounts recognised or disclosed in \\nthe next financial year are discussed below: \\nCommercial income \\nManagement is required to make estimates in determining the \\namount and timing of recognition of commercial income for some  \\ntransactions with suppliers. In determining the amount of volume-\\nrelated allowances recognised in any period, management estimates \\nthe probability that the Group will meet contractual target volumes, \\nbased on historical and forecast performance. There is limited \\nestimation involved in recognising income for promotional and \\nother  allowances.  \\nManagement assesses its performance against the obligations \\nconditional on earning the income, with the income recognised \\neither over time as the obligations are met, or recognised at the \\npoint when all obligations are met, dependent on the contractual \\nrequirements. Commercial income is recognised as a credit within \\ncost of sales. Where the income earned relates to inventories which \\nare held by the Group at period ends, the income is included within \\nthe cost of those inventories, and recognised in cost of sales upon \\nsale of those inventories. Management views that the cost of \\ninventories sold (which is inclusive of commercial income) provides a \\nconsistent and complete measure of the Group income statement \\nimpact of the overall supplier relationships. \\nManagement considers the best indicator of the estimation \\nundertaken is by reference to co mmercial income balances not \\nsettled at the balance sheet date, and has therefore provided \\nadditional disclosures of commercial income amounts reflected in \\nthe Group balance sheet. Refer to Note 20 for commercial income \\ndisclosures. Clubcard points breakage \\nClubcard points breakage is the proportion of points that are not \\nexpected to be redeemed by customers. Management estimates \\nbreakage based on historical experience of customer redemptions, \\nadjusted for any factors which may impact future redemption rates \\nsuch as scheme changes or expected future trends in customer \\nbehaviour. Changes in breakage estimates would change the \\nClubcard contract liability (deferred revenue) on balance sheet (see \\nNote 19) and the timing of revenue re cognised in relation to Clubcard \\npoints. \\nContingent liabilities \\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be \\nconfirmed only on the occurrence or non-occurrence of uncertain \\nfuture events outside the Group’s control, or present obligations \\nthat are not recognised because it is not probable that a settlement \\nwill be required or the value of such a payment cannot be reliably \\nestimated. The Group does not recognise contingent liabilities but \\ndiscloses them.

The Group led the formation of the entities and its name a ppears in the \\nname of the entities and/or on the debt issued by the entities. The structured entities were set up to finance property purchas es by some of the \\nUK property joint ventures in which the Group typically holds a 50% equity interest. The structured entities obtain debt financ ing from third-party \\ninvestors and lend the funds to these joint ventures, who use the funds to purchase the properties. \\nThe liabilities of the UK property joint ventures include the lo ans due to these structured entities. The Group’s exposure to t he structured entities \\nis limited to the extent of the Group’s interests in the joint ventures. The liabilities of the structured entities are non-rec ourse to the Group. \\nThe Group concluded that it does not control, and therefore should not consolidate, these structured entities since it does not  have power over \\nthe relevant activities of the structured entities, or exposure to variable returns from these entities.  \\nConsolidated structured entities \\nThe Group has a number of securitisation structured entities established in connection with Tesco Bank’s credit card securitisa tion transactions \\nas well as financing structured entities controlled as a result of the acquisition of UK property joint ventures. Although none  of the equity of these \\nentities is owned by the Group, the Group has rights to variable returns from its involvement with these entities and has the a bility to affect those \\nreturns through its powe r over them under contractual agreements. As  such, these entities are effectively controlled by the Group, and are \\ntherefore accounted for as subsidiaries of the Group. \\nThe securitisation structured entities have financial year ends of 31 December. The management accounts of these entities are u sed to \\nconsolidate the results to 25  February 2023 within these financial statements.

       " Document(page_content=' \\n  Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023 147 Financial statements \\nThe accounting period end dates of the joint ventures and associat es consolidated in these financial statements range from 31 D ecember 2022 \\nto 25 February 2023. The accounting period end dates of joint ventures differ from those of the Group for commercial reasons and d epend \\nupon  the requirements of the joint venture partner as well as those of the Group. The accounting period end dates of the associates are \\ndifferent from those of the Group as they depend upon the requirements of the parent companies of those entities. \\nThere are no significant restrictions on the ability of joint vent ures and associates to transfer funds to the parents, other t han those imposed by \\nthe Companies Act 2006 or equivalent local regulations.  \\nThe UK property joint ventures involve the Group partnering with  third parties in carrying out some property investments in ord er to enhance \\nreturns from property and access funding, while reducing risks associated with sole ownership. These property investments gener ally cover \\nshopping centres and standalone stores. The Group enters into leases for some or all of the properties held in the joint ventur es. These leases \\nprovide the Group with some rights over alterations and adjacent  land developments. In some cases the Group has the ability to substitute \\nproperties in the  joint ventures with alternative properties of similar value, su bject to strict eligibility criteria. In other cases, the Group carries out \\nproperty management activities for third-party rentals of shopping centre units. \\nThe property investment activities are carried out in separate entities, usually partnerships or limited liability companies. T he Group has assessed \\nits ability to direct the relevant activities of these entities and any impact on Group returns and concluded that the entities  qualify as joint \\nventures since decisions regarding them require the unanimous consent of both equity holders. This assessment included not only  rights within \\nthe joint venture agreements, but also any rights within other contractual arrangements between the Group and the entities. \\nThe Group made a number of judgements in arriving at this determination, the key ones being: \\n– since the provisions of the joint venture agreements require the relevant decisions impacting investor returns to be either una nimously agreed \\nby both joint venturers at the same time, or in some cases to be agreed sequentially by each venturer at different stages, ther e is joint decision \\nmaking within the joint venture; \\n– since the Group’s leases are priced at fair value, and any rights embedded in the leases are consistent with market practice, t hey do not \\nprovide the Group with additional control over the joint ventures nor do they infer an obligation by the Group to fund the sett lement of \\nliabilities of the joint ventures; \\n– any options to purchase the other joint venturers’ equity stakes are priced at market value, and only exercisable at future dat es, hence they \\ndo not provide control to the Group at the current time; \\n– where the Group has a right to substitute properties in the join t ventures, the rights are strictly limited and are at fair val ue, hence do not \\nprovide control to the Group; and \\n– where the Group carries out property management activities for third-party rentals in shopping centres, these additional activi ties are \\ncontrolled through joint venture agreements or lease agreements, and do not provide the Group with additional powers over the j oint venture. \\nDuring the current financial year, the Group obtained control of The Tesco Dorney Limited Partners hip, which was previously acc ounted for as a \\njoint venture, through the acquisition of the other partner’ s 50% interest. Refer to Note  33 for further details.  \\nSummarised financial information for joint ventures and associates \\nThe summarised financial information below reflects the amounts presented in the financial statements of the relevant joint ven tures and \\nassociates, and not the Group’s share of those amounts. These amou nts have been adjusted to conform to the Group’s accounting p olicies \\nwhere required.

The Group allocates goodwill to groups of cash-generating units, where each countr y represents a \\ngroup of cash-generating units for the Group’s retail operations, as this represents the lowest level at which goodwill is moni tored by \\nmanagement. Tesco Bank and dunnhumby each represent separate cash-generating units. \\nThe recoverable amount of each store cash-generating unit is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs of di sposal. The \\nrecoverable amount of a group of cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated is determined based on value in use  calculations. \\nCentral assets such as distribution centres and associated costs are allocated to store cash-generating units based on level of  use, estimated \\nwith reference to sales. Urban fulfilment centres and associated costs that are part of a store are included in the store cash– generating unit. \\nStandalone customer fulfilment centres and associated costs are each treated as a separate cash-generating unit.  \\nValue in use \\nRetail  \\nEstimates for value in use calculations include discount rates, lo ng-term growth rates, expected changes to future cash flows, including volumes \\nand prices, and the probabilities assigned to cash flow scenarios.  Estimates are based on past experience and expectations of f uture changes in \\nthe market, including the prevailing economic climate and global economy, competitor activity, market dynamics, changing custom er behaviours, \\nstructural challenges facing reta il and the resilience afforded by the Group’s operational scale.  \\nCash flow projections are based on the Group’s three-year internal forecasts, the results of which are reviewed by the Board. T he forecasts \\ninclude best estimate assumptions on inflation, which differ by  both country and revenue and co st categories. The forecasts are  extrapolated to \\nfive years based on management’s expectations, and beyond five years based on estimated long-term average growth rates. Long-te rm growth \\nrates for the Retail business are based on inflation forecasts by recognised bodies. Cash flow forecasts are allocated to store -level cash-\\ngenerating units based on their relative current year actual sa les performance, after adjusting for one-off cash flows affectin g particular stores. \\nFinancial statements\\n149 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023', metadata={'source': 'pdf files/tesco.pdf', 'page': 150}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Notes to the Group financial statements continued  \\n150 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023 Note 14 Impairment of non-current assets continued \\nThe Group applies an expected cash flow approach by probability-weighting different cash flow scenarios. The greatest probabili ty weighting \\nis applied to the cash flows derived from the three-year internal  forecasts. Additional scenarios take account of the risks  presented by a \\nmacroeconomic downturn, higher levels of operating costs and cl imate change, consistent with the viability statement scenarios (see the  \\nLonger  term viability statement in the Strategic report) as well as an upside scenario. The viability statement scenarios reflect ‘sev ere but \\nplausible’ risks which are adjusted for impairment testing in orde r to reflect management’s best estimate of future economic co nditions, \\nincluding any reasonably possible upside to the three-year internal forecasts. \\nIn addition to the climate change scenario included within the probability-weighted cash flows, the Group incorporates other cl imate change \\nrelated assumptions into the impairment modelling, including, but not limited to, investments in technology to aid the Group’s net zero \\ncommitments, the costs associated with replacing assets with more environmentally-friendly alternatives, and assumptions over t he cash flow \\nprofile of the Group’s fuel business. \\nManagement estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the market assessment as at the balance sheet date of the time value of \\nmoney and the risks specific to the cash-generating units. The pr e-tax discount rates are derived from the Group’s post-tax wei ghted average \\ncost of capital, as adjusted for the specific risks relating to each geographical region and on a nominal basis. Risk-free rate s are based on \\ngovernment bond rates in each  geographical region and equity risk premia and equity beta are based on forecasts by recognised bodies. \\nThe Group uses the capital asset pricing model to calculate the cost of equity. \\nTesco Bank goodwill \\nTesco Bank value in use is calculated by discounting equity cash  flows, defined as the excess above the regulatory requirement.  Cash flow \\nprojections are based on the Bank’s three-year internal forecasts,  approved by the Board. The forecasts are extrapolated to fiv e years based \\non management’s expectations and beyond five years based on estimated long-term average growth rates. The long-term growth rate is  based \\non inflation and GDP growth forecasts by recognised bodies. The discount rate is the cost of equity of Tesco Bank. Risk-free ra tes, equity risk \\npremia and the equity beta are derived from recognised bodies. \\nFair value less costs of disposal \\nFair values of owned properties are determined with regard to th e market rent for the stores or for alternative uses with inves tment yields \\nappropriate to reflect the physical characteristics of the prop erty, location, infrastructure, redevelopment potential and othe r factors. In  some \\ncases, fair values include residual valuations where stores may be  viable for redevelopment. Fair values of leased properties a re determined \\nwith regard to the discounted market rent for the property over the remaining period of the lease, reflecting the condition and loca tion of the \\nproperty and the local rental market, adjusted for a suitable void  period. Fair values of the Group’s properties were determine d with the \\nassistance of independent professional valuers where appropriate. Costs of disposal are estimated based on past experience in e ach \\ngeographical region. \\nInvestments in joint ventures and associates \\nThe recoverable values of investments in joint ventures and associates are estimated taking into account forecast cash flows, e quity valuations of \\ncomparable entities and/or recent tr ansactions for comparable businesses. \\nKey assumptions and sensitivity \\nKey assumptions \\nFor value in use calculations, the key assumptions to which the recoverable amounts are most sensitive are discount rates, long -term growth  \\nrates and future cash flows (incorporating sales volumes, prices and costs).

Refer to Note 14 \\nfor details of how risk-free rate s are derived. Where material, provisions are discounted based on country-specific nominal ris k-free rates, with a \\nweighted average risk-free rate of 3.8% (2022: 1.6%). \\nProperty provisions \\nProperty provisions comprise onerous contracts related to unprofitable stores and vacant properties, decommissioning provisions  and \\nremediation works and dilapidations provisions.  \\nDilapidations are recognised where there is a present obligation to repair and restore leased properties to their preoccupancy state at the end \\nof the lease term. The provision is based on best estimates for individual properties, with reference to previous experience and s ize of leased \\nproperty, or specific agreements with the landlord where relevant . The term is measured in accordance with the outstanding leng th of leases or \\nthe expected timing of specific obligations. \\nOnerous contract provisions are recognised where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the  economic \\nbenefits expected to be received under it. The timing of provisions is determined by reference to the contract giving rise to t he obligations.  \\nDecommissioning provisions reflect the Group’s long-term obligati on for site-level environmental remediation works, arising fro m government \\nregulations and changing consumer habits. The extent and cost of future environmental remediation represents a best estimate ap plied across \\nthe property portfolio based on past experience, the extent of re mediation work required and the expected timing of activity, f or which there is a \\nhigh level of uncertainty. \\nAmounts provided in the year primarily relate to decommissioning and amounts released in the year primarily relate to releases of dilapidation \\nand similar remediation provisions. \\nThe expected undiscounted ageing of proper ty provisions as at 25 February 2023: \\n Current  \\n£m 1 to 5 years  \\n£m 6 to 10 years  \\n£m 11 to 15 years  \\n£m Over 15 years  \\n£m Total  \\n£m \\nProperty provisions 38 46 23 17 247 371 \\nRestructuring provisions \\nRestructuring provisions of £106m, primarily relating to expected  employee costs, are expected to be fully utilised in the foll owing financial year to \\n24 February 2024. The provision is calculated in line with the expected settlement costs of impacted employees and excludes fut ure operating costs.  \\nLegal and regulatory provisions \\nLegal and regulatory provisions contain balances in relation to either ongoing or expected legal proceedings against the Group,  or for costs \\nassociated with regulatory matters and/or breaches. Due to the nature of legal and regulatory matters, including unpredictable timings of legal \\ncases or regulatory investigations, there is often uncertainty  as to if or when provisions will be fully utilised.  \\nThis balance consists of various individually immaterial provisions. \\nOperational insurance provisions \\nInsurance provisions relate to outstanding liabilities from publ ic and employer’s liability and third-party motor claims across  the Group’s trading \\noperations, separate to the Tesco Underwriting insurance balances in Note 24. Provisions relate to claims arising from incident s reported prior \\nto the reporting date, including an allowance for those currently in curred but not reported. Amounts are measured considering clai ms history, \\nincluding claims volume and average cost of  claims, with assessment and projection by third-party actuaries. Releases in the ye ar primarily relate \\nto improved estimates of future outflows from revised actuarial valuations. The balance as at the financial year end is expecte d to be materially \\nutilised within three years from the reporting date.  \\nOther provisions \\nOther provisions amounts primarily relate to a Tesco Bank expect ed credit loss provision recognised under IFRS 9 which exceeds the gross \\ncarrying amount of the related financial asset, primarily loans to  customers. Further information on expected credit losses can  be found within \\nNote 27.

Each no tified claim is assessed on a separate, case ‐by‐case basis with due regard to the claim circumstances and hist orical evidence of \\nthe size of similar claims and provisions are based on information currently available. However, the ultimate liabilities may v ary as a result of \\nsubsequent developments.  \\nSources of data \\nThe sources of data used as inputs for the assumptions are internal, using detailed studies that are carried out at least annua lly to ensure that \\nthe assumptions are consistent with observable market prices or other published information. When there is insufficient informa tion to make a \\nreliable best estimate of claims development, suitable benchmark assumptions are used. \\nMethods \\nThe cost of outstanding claims and the incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims provisions are estimated using various statistic al methods, which \\nextrapolate the development of paid and incurred claims, average cost per claim and ultimate claim numbers for each accident pe riod based \\nupon observed development of earlier periods, with reference to suitable benchmarks. The key methods are: \\n– development factor methods, which use historical data to estimate  the paid and incurred to date as proportions of the ultimate claim cost; \\n– individual claim assessment methods, which use claim ‐specific details for large individual claims to estimate the ultimate claim cost; and \\n– benchmarking methods, which use the experience of comparable, more mature classes, or market data to estimate the cost of claim s. \\nTo the extent that these methods use historical claims developmen t information, they also assume that the historical claims dev elopment \\npattern will occur again in the future, after allowing (where possible) for instances where this might not be the case, such as  changing economic \\nor legal trends. \\n  \\n156 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023', metadata={'source': 'pdf files/tesco.pdf', 'page': 157}),\n",

The methods used by the Group take into account his torical data, \\nspecific details for individual large claims and details of the reinsurance programme to assess the expected size of reinsuranc e recoveries. \\nRecoveries through salvage and subrogation are estimated and recorded separately based on a combination of suitable benchmark a ssumptions \\nand the observed development to date. \\nOgden rate \\nThe majority of claims are not discounted as they are expected to settle within four years or less. For long-term personal inju ry claims the \\npersonal injury discount rate (Ogden rate) is used. For claims provisions in relation to periodic payments orders, a long-term expected investment \\nreturn is used as the discount rate.

The financial risk management in relation to Retail is carried out by a centra l treasury \\ndepartment. Tesco Bank has a separate formal  structure for reporting, monitoring and managing its financial risks appropriate t o the nature of its \\nbusiness as a regulated financial institution.  \\nThe main financial risks faced by the Group, including Retail an d Tesco Bank, and the management of these risks are set out bel ow and include \\nmarket risk (foreign exchange, interest rate, inflation and commodity prices), credit risk, liquidity risk, capital risk and in surance risk. Additional \\ninformation on the management of the financial risks specifically relating to Tesco Bank is also set out on page 170.  \\nTesco Group  \\n(a) Market risk  \\nForeign exchange risk management \\nDescription of risks   Management policy   Hedging strategy \\nTransactional exposure that arises \\nfrom  the cost of future purchases of \\ngoods, where those purchases are \\ndenominated in a currency other than \\nthe functional currency of the \\npurchasing company.  The Group’s policy is to he dge currency exposure that \\ncould significantly impact the Group income statement \\nwith a minimum (20%) and maximum (80%) hedge level \\nof forecast uncommitted exposure within at least the \\nnext 12 months. \\n  Foreign currency forward contracts or purchased \\ncurrency options, which are designated as cash flow \\nhedges. These are denominated in the same currency \\nas the highly probable future sales and purchases, \\nwhich are expected to occur within a maximum 24-\\nmonth period, and the hedge ratio is determined \\nto be 1:1. \\nTranslation exposure that arises from \\nexchange rate movements in \\nconnection with translating the Group’s \\nforeign subsidiaries’ revenue and \\nexpenses, assets and liabilities into \\nPound Sterling.   Translation risk related to foreign subsidiaries is not \\nactively hedged, however to reduce this exposure in \\nrelation to the net assets of foreign subsidiaries, net \\ninvestment hedging is undertaken.  \\n  Euro-denominated borrowings are used to hedge the \\nexposure of a portion of the Group’s net investments in \\noverseas operations which have a  Euro functional \\ncurrency, against changes in value due to changes in \\nforeign exchange rates. The Group has established a \\nhedge ratio of 1:1, as the underlying risk of the hedging \\ninstrument is identical to the hedged risk component. \\nLoans to and from subsidiaries in \\ncurrencies other than in the entity’s \\nfunctional currency.  The Group’s policy is that 100% of the foreign exchange \\nrisk is hedged.   Foreign currency derivatives and borrowings in \\nmatching currencies, which are not formally designated \\nas accounting hedges as gains and losses will naturally \\noffset in the income statement. \\nDebt issued in a currency other than \\nPound Sterling.  The Group’s policy is to swap 100% of the foreign \\ncurrency debt back to Pound Sterling, unless there are \\nappropriate matching foreign currency assets.   Cross-currency swaps, which are designated as fair \\nvalue hedges. \\nResidual exposure is present arising largely from cash and cash  equivalents balances that are not in the functional currency of  the entity holding \\nthese balances. The Group income statement impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on these residual balances is dis closed in the \\nsensitivity table on page 164.  \\nInterest rate risk management \\nDescription of risks   Management policy   Hedging strategy  \\nDebt issued at variable interest rates as \\nwell as cash deposits and short-term \\ninvestments, giving rise to cash flow risk, \\nand debt issued at fixed interest rates \\ngiving rise to fa ir value risk.  \\n  The Group’s policy is to manage interest rate risk in \\ntotal balance sheet debt (including senior unsecured \\ndebt, lease liabilities, cash and cash equivalents and \\ninvestments) to a range of 55%-85% fixed. \\n \\n  Interest rate swap contracts are used to fix interest \\nrates on senior unsecured debt or investments issued \\nat floating rates, creating a fair value hedge; and for \\nsenior unsecured debt or investments issued at fixed \\nrates to generate variable interest exposure, creating a \\ncashflow hedge. The terms of the swap contracts \\nmatch the terms of the borrowings or investments \\nincluding notional amounts and maturity, interest \\nsettlement and interest rate reset dates, and the \\nGroup has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 for the \\nhedging relationships as the underlying risk of the \\nderivative contract is identical to that of the \\nhedged  item.  \\nDifferent repricing dates of the assets \\nand liabilities in Tesco Bank’s banking \\nactivities and unexpected changes to \\nthe yield curve, giving rise to volatility in \\nearnings and economic value of these \\nassets and liabilities.

However, it does include the foreign exchange sensitivity resultin g from local entity \\nnon-functional currency financial instruments. \\nThe sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest ra tes of the debt and  \\nderivatives portfolio, and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of t he hedge designations \\nin place at 25 February 2023. It should be noted that the sensitivity analysis reflects the impact on income and equity due to financial instruments \\nheld at the balance sheet date. It does not reflect any change in sales or costs that may result from changing interest or  exchange rates.  \\nThe following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: \\n– the sensitivity of interest payable to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, deposi ts and derivative \\ninstruments with no sensitivity assumed for RPI-linked borrowings, which have been swapped to fixed rates; \\n– changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges against movements in interest  rates or foreign \\nexchange rates have an immaterial effect on the Group income st atement and equity due to compensating adjustments in the carryi ng value \\nof debt; \\n– changes in the carrying value of financial instruments designated as net investment hedges against movements in foreign exchang e rates are \\nrecorded directly in the Group stat ement of comprehensive income/(loss); \\n– all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments are fully effecti ve with no impact \\non the Group income statement; and \\n– the floating leg of any swap or any floating rate debt is treated as not having any interest rate already set, therefore a chan ge in interest rates \\naffects a full 12-month period for the interest payable portion of the sensitivity calculations. \\nUsing the above assumptions, the following table shows the quantitative effect on the Group income statement and the Group stat ement of \\nchanges in equity that would result, at the balance sheet date, from changes in interest rates,  inflation rates, currency excha nge rates and \\ncommodity prices that  are reasonably possible for major currencies where there have recently been significant movements: \\n 2023  2022 \\n Income  \\ngain/(loss)  \\n£m Equity  \\ngain/(loss)  \\n£m  Income  \\ngain/(loss)  \\n£m Equity  \\n gain/(loss)  \\n£m \\n1% increase in interest rates (2022: 1%) (48) 3  12 4 \\n5% appreciation of the Euro (2022: 10%) (11) (79)  (19) (123) \\n10% appreciation of the US Dollar (2022: 10%) 34 118  (11) 69 \\n50 basis points parallel upward shift in the forward inflation curve (2022: 100 basis points) 101 –  337 – \\n10% increase in commodity prices (2022: 10%)* 1 13  1 9 \\n* Relating to diesel prices only, where derivatives are used to hedge risk. \\nA decrease in interest rates and commodity prices, depreciation of foreign currencies and downward shift in the forward inflati on curve would \\nhave the opposite effect to the impact in the table above. \\nThe impact on the Group income statement resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates against GBP in relation to financial instruments \\n(excluding those arising on consolidation) is minimal as Group policy dictates that all material income statement foreign excha nge exposures \\nare hedged.  \\nIn prior years, the Group entered into a number of derivative in dex-linked contracts with external counterparties, to economica lly hedge a \\nproportion of the Group’s exposure to index-linked lease liabil ities with its joint ventures. These are specifically not design ated as accounting \\nhedges, but are economic hedges. However, the gains and losses on the hedging instrument and hedged item do not  naturally offset in the Group \\nincome statement. This mismatch arises due to different accounting outcomes of IFRS 9 and IFRS 16, which results in a timing di fference.  \\nThe impact on the Group statement of comprehensive income/(loss) from changing exchange rates results from the revaluation of f inancial \\nliabilities used as net investment hedges. The impact on the Group statement of comprehensive income/(loss) will largely be off set by the \\nrevaluation in equity of the hedged assets in the Group statement of changes in equity. \\nDerivatives and hedging exposures  \\nDerivatives are used to hedge exposure to market risks, some of which are economic hedges and others are formally designated he dging \\ninstruments with hedge accounting applied. The main sources of hedge ineffectiveness are the effects of the counterparties’ and  the Group’s \\nown credit risk on the fair value of derivatives. \\nThe fair value and notional amounts of derivatives analysed by hedge type are shown on page 165. \\n  \\n164 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023', metadata={'source': 'pdf files/tesco.pdf', 'page': 165}),\n",

The \\npolicy is to maintain a prudent level of cash together \\nwith sufficient committed bank facilities to meet \\nliquidity needs as they arise, to maintain a smooth debt \\nprofile and ensure maturing senior unsecured debt will \\nnot exceed £1.5bn in any 12-month period.

In carrying out this po licy, Tesco Bank has regard to the supervisory requirements \\nof the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). \\nInsurance capital \\nSolvency II (SII) came into force on 1 January 2016. It provides a framework for managing and \\nmeasuring the risks and the solvency position for all insurance companies in the EU. \\nFollowing the UK’s departure from the EU, the SII framework continues to be applied in the \\nUK and its requirements are a pplicable to TU. TU assesses its Solvency Capital Requirement \\n(SCR) using a Partial In ternal Model for capital which wa s approved by the PRA in 2020. TU \\nmodels a range of stress and scenario tests that are published in its annual Solvency and \\nFinancial Condition Report . These show that TU’s capital posi tion is resilient to a range of \\npossible scenarios.

Tesco Bank has \\nelected to use the transitional arrangements available under Ar ticle 473a of the Capital Requirements Regulations (CRR). These arrangements \\nallow the IFRS 9 impact on capital to be phased in over a period of five years. On 27 June 2020, the CRR was further amended to  accelerate \\nspecific CRR2 measures and implement a new IFRS 9 transitional relief calculation which applies additional relief to increases in expected credit \\nlosses (ECL) provisions arising as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. \\nThe resulting impact is the IFRS 9 transitional arrangements have  been extended by two years and a new modified calculation has  been introduced. \\nInsurance capital \\nAvailable capital has remained above the SCR requirement during the period to 25 February 2023 and capital coverage of TU’s SCR  at the end of \\nFebruary 2023 was 159.0% (2022: 151.0%) (unaudited). \\nDuring the year, the Group was compliant with the externally imposed capital requirements. \\n(b) Liquidity risk \\nDescription of risk  Management policy  \\nThe risk that Tesco Bank has insufficient liquidity resources to \\nmeet its obligations as they fall due. Funding risk is the risk \\nthat Tesco Bank does not have sufficiently stable and diverse \\nsources of funding. \\n  Tesco Bank, including TU , operates within a liquidity ri sk management policy framework \\n(LRMP) to ensure that sufficient funds are available at all times to meet demands from \\ndepositors, to fund agreed advances, to me et other commitments as and when they fall \\ndue, and to ensure risk appetite is met. \\nLiquidity and funding risks are assessed through the individual liquidity adequacy \\nassessment process on at least an annual basis. Formal limits are set within the LRMP to \\nmaintain liquidity risk exposures within the liquidity risk appetite set by Tesco Bank’s Board \\nof Directors and key liquidity measures are monitored on a regular basis. Tesco Bank \\nmaintains a conservative liquidity and funding profile to confirm that it is able to meet \\nits financial obligations under normal and stressed market conditions. \\nThe table below shows information about the timing of cash outflows in relation to insurance claims liabilities, net of salvage  and subrogation \\nrecoveries, based on current best estimates.

To minimise the potential exposure to bad debts that are outside risk appetite, processes, \\nsystems and limits have been established that  cover the end-to-end retail credit risk \\ncustomer life cycle. These include credit scoring, affordability, credit  policies and guides, \\nand monitoring and reporting. The Bank is also exposed to wholesale credit risk primarily \\nthrough its treasury activities. \\nControls and risk mitigants include daily monitoring of exposures, investing in \\ncounterparties with investment-grade ratings, restricting the amount that can be invested \\nwith one counterparty and credit-rating mi tigation techniques. Assessment of the \\nexpected credit loss (ECL) on loans and advances to customers has taken into account a \\nrange of macroeconomic scenarios.  \\nReinsurance assets are subjec t to annual impairment assessment based on the credit \\nratings of the existing reinsurers which are monitored by TU’s Reinsurance Committee. \\n  \\nFinancial statements\\n171 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023', metadata={'source': 'pdf files/tesco.pdf', 'page': 172}),\n",

This include s instances where: \\n– the customer makes a declaration of significant financial difficulty;  \\n– the customer or third-party agency communicates that it is probable that the customer will enter bankruptcy or another form of financial \\nrestructure such as inso lvency or repossession; \\n– the account has been transferred to recove ries and the relationship is terminated; \\n– an account’s contractual payments are more than 90 days past due; or \\n– where the customer is deceased. \\nA loan deemed uncollectable is written off against the related provision after all of the necessary procedures have been comple ted and the \\namount of the loss has been determined. Tesco Bank may write of f loans that are still subject to enforcement activity. The outs tanding \\ncontractual amount of such assets written off was £115m (2022: £110m). \\nSignificant increase in credit risk \\nAt each reporting date, the change in credit risk of the financial asset is observed using a set of quantitative and qualitativ e criteria, together \\nwith a backstop based on arrears status. For each financial asset, Tesco Bank compares the lifetime PD at the reporting date with th e lifetime \\nPD that was expected at the reporting date at initial recognition (PD threshold). Tesco Bank has established PD thresholds for eac h type of \\nproduct which vary depending on initial term and term remaining. A number of qualitative criteria are in place such as: forbearance offered t o \\ncustomers in financial difficulty; risk-based pricing post-origi nation; credit indebtedness; credit limit decrease; and pre-delinquency information. \\nAs a backstop, Tesco Bank considers that if an account’s contract ual payments are more than 30 days past due then a significant  increase in \\ncredit risk has taken place.  \\nTesco Bank has commissioned four scenarios from its third-party provider: a Base scenario; an Upside scenario; and two differen t Downside \\nscenarios. The Base scenario assumes the continuation of war in Ukraine affecting energy prices and inflation, with GDP not exp ected to return to \\npre-pandemic levels until Q2 2025. The scenario projects cost-o f-living pressures continuing, real disposable income declining and \\nunemployment peaking at 5.7% by Q4 2024. The Upside scenario s ees a dissipation in global supply chain disruption and a peak un employment \\nrate of 4.4% in 2024, while Downside scenario 1 assumes a 7.3% unemployment peak by 2025. Downside scenario 2 postulates spikes  in energy \\nprices, higher inflation and further deprecation of Sterling against the US Dollar, with subsequent GDP declines and a 9.6% une mployment peak in \\n2025. These scenarios are also reviewed to ensure an unbiased estimate of ECL by ensuring the credit loss distribution under a larger number of \\nscenarios is adequately captured using these four scenarios and their respective weightings. The Base, Upside, Downside 1 and D ownside 2 \\nscenarios have been assigned weighting of 40%, 30%, 25% and 5% respectively. \\nThe economic scenarios used include the following ranges of key indicators: \\nAs at 25 February 2023 (five-year average)  Base  \\n40% Upside  \\n30% Downside 1  \\n25% Downside 2  \\n5% \\nBank of England base rate(a) 3.8%  3.0%  4.7%  5.8%  \\nGross domestic product(b) 1.0%  1.5%  0.4%  (0.1)%  \\nUnemployment rate 5.2%  4.2%  6.5%  8.4%  \\nUnemployment rate peak in year 5.4%  4.2%  6.8%  8.9%  \\n     \\nAs at 26 February 2022 (five-year average)  Base  \\n40% Upside  \\n30% Downside 1  \\n25% Downside 2  \\n5% \\nBank of England base rate(a) 1.0%  1.2% 0.7%  0.4%  \\nGross domestic product(b) 1.8%  2.2%  1.5%  1.2% \\nUnemployment rate 4.1%  3.9%  4.9%  6.3%  \\nUnemployment rate peak in year 4.2%  3.9%  5.1%  6.7%  \\n(a) Simple average. \\n(b) Annual growth rates. \\n  \\n174 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023', metadata={'source': 'pdf files/tesco.pdf', 'page': 175}),\n",

Forbearance is relief granted by a lender to assist customers in financi al difficulty, through \\narrangements which temporarily allow the customer to pay an amou nt other than the contractual amounts due. These temporary arra ngements \\nmay be initiated by the customer or Tesco Bank where financial distress would prevent repayment within the original terms and c onditions of the \\ncontract. The main aim of forbearance is to support customers in returning to a position where they are able to meet their cont ractual obligations. \\nTesco Bank has adopted the definition of forbearance in the European Banking Authority’s (EBA) final draft Implementing Technic al Standards (ITS) \\nof July 2014 and reports all accounts meeting this definition, providing for them appropriately.  \\nTesco Bank has well defined forbearance policies and processes. A number of forbearance options are made available to customers . These \\nroutinely, but not exclusively, include the following: \\n– arrangements to repay arrears over a period of time, by making payments above the contractual amount, that ensure the loan is r epaid within \\nthe original repayment term; and \\n– short-term concessions, where the borrower is allowed to make re duced repayments (or in exceptio nal circumstances, no repayment s) on a \\ntemporary basis to assist with short-term financial hardship. \\n Gross loans and \\nadvances subject to \\nforbearance programmes  Forbearance programmes as a \\nproportion of total loans and  \\nadvances  by category  Proportion of forbearance \\nprogrammes covered by allowance  \\nfor expected credit losses \\n 2023  \\n£m 2022  \\n£m  2023  \\n% 2022  \\n%  2023  \\n% 2022  \\n% \\nCredit cards  102 106  3 3  49 51 \\nLoans 30 39  1 1  31 47 \\n(d) Insurance risk \\nDescription of risk  Management policy  \\nRisks accepted through the provision of insurance products \\nin return for a premium, exp osed through the wholly-owned \\nsubsidiary of Tesco Bank, TU.

The Group has large numbers of policyholders with homogeneous \\nexposures such as car and home policies. Products are priced \\nbased on the Group’s knowledge using past exposures, historical \\nlosses  (plus an appropriate  allowance  for IBNR  losses)  and external  \\ndata sources, with the appropriate adjustments to reflect \\nanticipated future market conditions and expenses. \\nClaims reserving Estimates of insurance liabilities prove to be \\ninsufficient through inaccura te forecasting, adverse \\nrandom variation and additional expenses.  The aim of the reserving policy is to provide estimates of \\ninsurance liabilities that are accurate and reliable across each line \\nof business and are consistent over the time period required to \\nsettle all the claims. Provisions are monitored on an ongoing basis \\nby a Reserving Committee and the TU Board, and an annual \\nindependent review is undertaken. \\nClaims management Claims management risk may arise in the event of \\ninaccurate or incomple te case reserving or \\nsettlement, poor customer service, claims fraud, \\nineffective or inefficient claim processes or \\nexcessive  costs of handling claims.  The Group’s approach to claims management focuses upon \\ncreating a successful balance between satisfying the needs of the \\ncustomer against control of the overall cost of the provision of \\nthe service that meets those needs in agreement with its service \\nprovider. Customers include both the insured as well as others \\nthat believe the insured has breached a duty of care. \\nReinsurance Reinsurance contracts, plac ed to reduce exposure \\nto specific risks, event and accumulations, fail to \\nperform as planned and do not reduce the gross \\ncost  of claims in terms of the limits purchased, \\nby risks not being appropriately covered, by \\nreinsurance  bad debts or by there not being gaps \\nin the programme.  The reinsurance programme is subject to considerable scenario \\nplanning and approved by the Reinsurance Committee and the \\nTU Board. All reinsurers in the reinsurance programme have a \\nminimum credit rating of A.  \\nConcentration of insurance risk \\nConcentration of insurance risk may exist where a particular event or series of events could impact significantly upon the Grou p’s liabilities. Such \\nconcentrations may arise from a single insu rance contract or through a small number of related contracts. The following are key  categories of \\nconcentration risks that might result in significant impacts to the Group: \\nCategory Description  Mitigation \\nHigh-severity,  \\nlow-frequency event \\nconcentrations High-severity, low-frequency events (e.g. natural \\ndisasters)  represent  a material  risk as the occurrence  \\nof such an event would have a significant adverse \\nimpact on TU’s cash flows and profitability.  Making appropriate allowance within the price calculated by \\nunderwriters and by purchasing a reinsurance programme that \\nlimits the impact of these events, using non-proportional \\nreinsurance treaties to manage retention levels and the limits \\nof protection. \\nGeographic and \\ndemographic \\nconcentrations Material geographical concentrations of risk exist \\nin property portfolios such that natural disasters \\n(e.g.  floods) may give rise to a large number of \\nmaterial damage and business interruption claims.  The Group only writes policies in the UK. TU  models its  exposure  to \\nthis risk to estimate its probable maximum loss and purchases \\nreinsurance to significantly reduce its exposure to such events. \\nEconomic conditions The insurance portfolio exposes a potential \\naccumulation of different risks in the event of difficult  \\neconomic conditions or more challenging points in \\nthe underwriting cycle.  The Group aims to ensure it charges the right premium for the \\nbusiness underwritten and it focuses on maintaining prices in \\nsuch  difficult market conditions. It also monitors claims closely \\nto identify any that may be exaggerated or fraudulent. \\nTotal aggregate \\nexposure The total aggregate exposure that the Group is \\nprepared to accept in relation to concentrations \\nof risk.  The exposures are monitored on a regular basis by reviewing \\nreports which show the key aggregations to which the Group is \\nexposed and by using a number of modelling tools to monitor \\naggregation and simulate catastrophe losses in order to measure \\nthe effectiveness of the reinsurance programmes, and to quantify \\nthe net exposure. Additional stress and scenario tests are run \\nusing these models during the year. \\nTU has carried out sensitivity analyses on the reasonably possible changes in its key business drivers, including interest yiel ds, expenses and gross \\nloss ratio, as well as executing the stress and scenario testin g programme on the insurance risk as part of their contingency p lanning. These do \\nnot indicate a material impact to the Group’ s overall financial position and performance.   \\n176 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023', metadata={'source': 'pdf files/tesco.pdf', 'page': 177}),\n",

The Group has no fu rther payment \\nobligations once its contributions have been paid. Contributions paid for defined contribution schemes in continuing operations  of £375m (2022: \\n£361m) have been recognised in the Group income statement. This includes £143m (2022: £136m) of salaries paid as pension contri butions. \\nDefined benefit schemes \\nThe Group has a defined benefit pension deficit of £400m (2022: £303m deficit), and a defined benefit pension surplus of £6m (2 022: £3,150m), \\ncomprising a number of schemes. The most significant schemes are for the Group’s employees in the UK and ROI, which are closed to future \\naccrual. The defined benefit pension deficit in the UK represents 102% of the net Group deficit. In the prior year, the defined  benefit pension \\nsurplus in the UK represented 103% of the net Group surplus. \\nUnited Kingdom \\nThe principal plan within the Group is the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme  (the Scheme), the assets of which are held as a segregated fund and \\nadministered by the Trustee. \\nThe Scheme is established under trust law and has a corporate truste e (the Trustee) that is required to run the Scheme in accor dance with the \\nScheme’s Trust Deed and Rules and to comply with all relevant legislation. Responsibility for governance of the Scheme lies wit h the Trustee. \\nThe Trustee is a company whose directors comprise: \\n1. representatives of the Group; \\n2. independent trustees; and \\n3. representatives of the Scheme participants, in accordance with its articles of association and UK pension law. \\nScheme funding \\nThe Group considers two measures of the pension surplus/deficit. The accounting position is shown on the Group balance sheet. T he funding \\nposition, calculated at the triennial funding valuation, is used to agree contributions made to the schemes. The two measures w ill vary because \\nthey  are for different purposes, and are calculated at different date s and in different ways. The key calculation difference is that  the funding \\nposition considers the expected returns of scheme assets when calculating the liability, whereas the accounting, position calcu lated under IAS  19 \\ndiscounts liabilities based on corporate bond yields. \\nThe most recent completed triennial funding valuation of the Scheme was performed as at 31 March 2022 using the projected unit credit method. \\nThe funding position was  a surplus of £0.9bn. The Scheme remained in a funding surplus as at 25 February 2023.  \\nSubsequent to this triennial funding valuation it was agreed that no further pension deficit contributions would be required, w ith contributions \\nnext expected to be assessed at the 31 March 2025 triennial revi ew. The Group was paying £25m per annum to meet expenses of the  Scheme, \\nincluding the Pension Protection Fund levy. This expense payment fell to £17m per annum from October 2022. In addition the mark et value of \\nassets held as security in favour of the Scheme is at least £775m (2022: £775m).  \\nThe most recent Booker Pension Scheme triennial funding valuatio n showed a funding deficit of £139m at 31 March 2022, with agre ed \\ncontributions of £17m per annum until the end of 2028. The most recent Budgens Pension Scheme triennial funding valuation showe d a funding \\nsurplus of £0.4m at 31 March 2021. No contribu tions were required for the Budgens Scheme. \\nIFRIC 14 \\nFor schemes in an accounting surplus position, these surpluses are recognised on the balance sheet in line with IFRIC 14, as th e Group has an \\nunconditional legal right to any future economic benefits by way of future refunds following a gradual settlement.   \\n180 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023', metadata={'source': 'pdf files/tesco.pdf', 'page': 181}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=' \\n  Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023 181 Financial statements \\nMaturity profile of the defined benefit obligation \\nThe estimated duration of the Scheme defined benefit obligation is an indicator of the weighted average term of benefit payment s after \\ndiscounting. For the Scheme this is 18 years. \\nAround 39% of the undiscounted benefits are due to be paid beyond 30 years’ time, with the last payments expected to be over 80  years from \\nnow. The estimated undiscounted benefit payments expected to be paid out over the life of the Scheme are shown below.  \\nThe defined benefit obligation held by the Scheme is broken down as follows:  \\n % \\nDeferred members 77 \\nCurrent pensioners 23 \\nRisks \\nThe Group bears a number of risks in relation to the Scheme, which are described below: \\nRisk  Description of risk  Mitigation \\nInvestment  The Scheme’s defined benefit \\nobligation is calculated using a \\ndiscount rate set with reference to \\ncorporate bond yields. If the return on \\nthe Scheme’s assets underperform \\nthis rate, the accounting deficit \\nwill increase. \\nIf the Scheme’s assets underperform \\nthe expected return for the funding \\nvaluation, this  may require additional \\ncontributions to be  made by the \\nGroup.  The Trustee and the Group regularly moni tor the funding position and operate a \\ndiversified investment strategy. \\nThe Trustee and the Group take a balanced approach to investment risk and have a \\nlong-term plan to significantly reduce the investment risk within the Scheme. \\nThe Trustee considers climate risk as one of the key investment risks faced by the \\nScheme and has set up a Responsible Investment Committee to consider climate-\\nrelated issues relating to the Scheme. \\nThe Scheme has also made a commitment to aim for investments to be net zero by 2050. \\nFurther details on the metrics, targets and acti ons taken in relation to climate risk can be \\nseen in the Scheme’s Climate Change Report. \\nInflation  The Scheme’s defined benefit \\nobligation is linked to  inflation. A higher \\nrate of expected long-term inflation \\nwill therefore lead to higher liabilities, \\nboth for the IAS  19 and funding liability. \\nIf the Scheme’s funding liability \\nincreases, this may  require additional \\ncontributions to be made by \\nthe Group.  As part of the investment strategy, the Trustee aims to mitigate this risk through \\ninvestment in a liability-driven investment (LDI)  portfolio. \\nThe portfolio invests in assets which increase in value as inflation expectations increase. \\nThis mitigates the impact of any adverse movement in long -term inflation expectations. \\nThe Scheme’s holdings are designed to hedge against inflation risk  for most of the \\nfunded liabilities. \\nAdditionally, changes to future benefits were introduced in June 2012 to reduce the \\nScheme’s exposure to inflation risk by changing the basis for calculating the rate of \\nincrease in pensions to CPI (previously RPI). \\nInterest rate  A decrease in corporate bond yields in \\nisolation is expected  to increase the \\naccounting deficit. Similarly, a \\ndecrease in gilt yields in isolation is \\nexpected to have an adverse impact \\non the funding position of the Scheme. \\nThis may lead to additional \\ncontributions being made by the  \\nGroup.  As part of the investment strategy, the Trustee aims to mitigate this risk through \\ninvestment in an LDI portfolio.  \\nThe portfolio invests in assets which increase  in value as interest rates decrease. The \\nScheme’s holdings are designed to hedge against interest rate risk for most of the \\nfunded liabilities.  \\nBecause the aim of the portfolio is to mitigate risk for the funding position, \\nineffectiveness in hedging for the accounting deficit can arise where corporate bond \\nand gilt yields diverge. This is partially offset by the Scheme’s holdings in corporate \\nbonds. \\nUsing an LDI portfolio means a rise in interest rates can lead to collateral calls. The \\nTrustee and the Group regularly monitor and ma nage the level of liquidity to ensure it \\nremains appropriate. \\nLife expectancy  The Scheme’s obligations are to \\nprovide benefits fo r the life of the \\nmember and so increases in life \\nexpectancy will lead to a higher \\ndefined benefit obligation.  To reduce this risk, changes to  future benefits were introduc ed in June 2012 to increase \\nthe age at which members ca n take their full pension by around two years.  \\nThe Trustee and the Group regularly monitor th e impact of changes in longevity on the \\nScheme defined b enefit obligation. \\n  70+ 66-70 61-65 56-60 51-55 46-50 41-45 36-40 31-35 26-30 21-25 16-20 11-15 6-10 1-5012345£bn\\nDeferred members Current pensionersYears\\nFinancial statements\\n181 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023', metadata={'source': 'pdf files/tesco.pdf', 'page': 182}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Notes to the Group financial statements continued  \\n182 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023 Note 29 Post-employment benefits continued  \\nThe operations and audit pensions committee was set up in 2015 to further strengthen the Scheme ’s Trustee governance and provid e greater \\noversight and stronger internal control over the Group’s risks. The Group pensions committee was also set up in 2018 to provide  an additional \\nlayer of  governance and risk management. Further mitigation of the risks is provided by external advisors and the Trustee who considers the \\nfunding position, fund performance and impacts of any regulatory changes. \\nScheme principal assumptions \\nFinancial assumptions \\nThe principal assumptions, on a weighted av erage basis, used by external actuaries to  value the defined benefit obligation of t he Scheme were as  \\nfollows: \\n 2023  \\n% 2022  \\n% \\nDiscount rate 4.9 2.8 \\nPrice inflation 3.0 3.3 \\nRate of increase in deferred pensions* 2.6 2.9 \\nRate of increase in pensions in payment*   \\nBenefits accrued before 1 June 2012 2.9 3.1 \\nBenefits accrued after 1 June 2012 2.5 2.8 \\n* In excess of any guaranteed minimum pension (GMP) element. \\nDiscount rate \\nThe discount rate for the Scheme is determined by reference to ma rket yields of high-quality corporate bonds of suitable curren cy and term  to \\nthe Scheme cash flows and extrapolated based on the trend observable in corporate bond yields. \\nInflation \\nThe inflation assumption is used to determine increases in pensions linked to RPI and CPI inflation within sections of the Sche me, subject to \\nrelevant maximum and minimum increases. \\nRPI inflation is derived by reference to the difference between fixed-interest and index-linked long-term government bonds. To account for the \\npremium that investors are willing to pay to mitigate the risk that inflation is higher than expected, the inflation assumption  incorporates an \\ninflation risk premium. CPI inflation is set by reference to RPI. \\nThe Group uses a bifurcated approach to pr e- and post-2030 assumptions, reflecting the impact of the RPI reforms from 2030 onwa rds. \\nIn consultation with external actuaries, the inflation risk premium has been set at 0.3% p.a. pre-2030 and 0.5% p.a. post-2030, wh ich is a \\nweighted average of 0.43% (2022: 0.42%). The CPI differential has be en set as 1.0% p.a. pre-2030 and 0.1% p.a. post-2030, which  is a weighted \\naverage of 0.48% lower than RPI (2022: 0.39%). \\nMortality assumptions \\nThe Trustee’s actuary conducted a mortality an alysis of the Scheme as part of the triennial funding valuation process. Subseque nt to this analysis, \\nthe Group adopted the best estimate assumptions for the calculation of the defined benefit obligation for the main UK scheme.  \\nThe mortality assumptions used are based on tables that have been projected to 2018 with CMI 2020 improvements. In addition, th e allowance  \\nfor future mortality improvements from 2018 has been updated to be in line with CMI 2021, with a long-term improvement rate  of 1.25% p.a. and a \\n10% weighting applied to both 2020 and 2021 data, reflecting the expectation that the COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on fu ture life \\nexpectancies. \\nThe base tables used in calculating the mortality assumptions are different for various categories of members, as shown below: \\n  Pensioner Non-Pensioner \\nMale Staff 96% of SAPS S3 Normal Hea vy 100% of SAPS S3 Normal Heavy \\n Senior Manager 112% of SAPS S3 Normal Light 113% of SAPS S3 Normal Light \\nFemale Staff 105% of SAPS S3 Normal Heavy 109% of SAPS S3 Normal Heavy \\n Senior Manager 87% of SAPS S3 All Middle 87% of SAPS S3 All Middle \\nThe following table illustrates the expectation of life of an average member retiring at age 65 at the balance sheet date and a  member reaching \\nage 65 at the balance sheet date +25 years.

In addition, Tesco PLC will guarantee any contingent and prospective liabilit ies that \\nthese subsidiaries are subject to.  \\nTesco Bank \\nAt 25 February 2023, Tesco Bank had contractual lending commitments totalling £12.2bn (2022: £12.4bn). The contractual amounts represent \\nthe amounts that would be at risk should the available facilities be  fully drawn upon and not the amounts at risk at the reporting date. \\nContingent liabilities \\nAs previously reported, Tesco Stores Limited (TSL) (along with all the major supermarkets) has re ceived claims from current and  former hourly-\\npaid store colleagues alleging that they do work of equal value to that of colleagues working in its distribution centres and t hat differences in \\nterms and conditions relating to pay are not objectively justif iable (the Equal Pay Claims). The claimants are seeking the diff erential between the \\npay terms looking back, and equivalence of pay terms moving forward. As at the date of this disclosure, there are approximately  42,000 claims \\nagainst TSL, with the number of claims expected to continue to increase as the litigation progresses. \\nUK equal pay law provides that an employee is entitled to the same terms in relation to pay as those of a comparator of the opp osite sex in the \\nsame employment if they are employed to do work of equal value. The legislation achieves this by implying a clause into the contract of \\nemployment, which has the effect of importing into the employee’s contract the more favourable term(s) of the comparator. \\nEqual pay claims are typically heard in three stages and the clai mants have to win at every stage in order to succeed. The firs t stage is \\ncomparability, which is effectively a technical gateway to the cl aims proceeding. The claimants have to show that there is a va lid basis in law for \\ncomparing their pay and the pay of any comparator. One of the lega l bases here is that pay terms are set by the same body. Foll owing a European \\ncourt ruling on this, TSL has made a concession on comparability. \\nThe second and third stages are an equal value assessment and th e consideration of TSL’s material factor defences (non-discrimi natory reasons \\nfor differentials in pay terms) to any claims which succeed at the equal value assessment stage. Completion of these two stages  is a lengthy \\nprocess and likely to take many years with hearings and appeals a part of that process. A final date is impossible to predict w ith any certainty and \\nany final decision may be delayed further by any final appeals. \\nAt present, the total number of Equal Pay Claims that may be received, the merits, and likely outcome of those claims and of TS L’s defences to \\nthem, and the potential impact on the Group, are subject to various and substantial uncertainties. There are multiple factual a nd legal defences \\nto these claims and the Group intends to defend them vigorously, while at the same time taking appropriate steps to mitigate th e risks. The \\nGroup therefore cannot make an assessment of the likely outcome of the litigation, or the potential quantum of its liability or  the potential impact \\non the Group at this stage. Depending on the outcome at the various stages of the Equal Pay Claims, and dependent on the number  of any \\nultimately successful claims, the potential quantum of its liability could be material. \\nThere are a number of other contingent liabilities that arise in the normal course of business, which if realised, are not expe cted to result in a \\nmaterial liability to the Group. \\nNote 35 Events after the reporting period \\nOn 27 February, the Group issued a €500m and a £250 m bond, maturing 2031 and 2035 respectively. There  were no other events after the \\nreporting period requ iring disclosure. \\n \\n190 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023', metadata={'source': 'pdf files/tesco.pdf', 'page': 191}),\n",

The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity \\nunder FRS 100, ‘Application of Financial Reporting Requirements’ \\nas issued by the Financial Reporting Council. \\nThe Company’s financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, \\nits functional currency, generally rounded to the nearest  million. \\nThe principal accounting policies adopted by the Company are \\nset out in Note 2. The financial statements have been prepared \\nunder the historical cost convention, except for certain financial \\ninstruments and share-based payments that have been \\nmeasured  at fair value. \\nNote 2 Accounting policies \\nBasis of preparation of  financial statements \\nThe Parent Company financial statements have been prepared in \\naccordance with FRS 101 and the Companies Act 2006 (the Act).  \\nFRS 101 sets out a reduced disclosure framework for a ‘qualifying \\nentity’ as defined in the standard, which addresses the financial \\nreporting requirements and disclosure exemptions in the \\nindividual  financial statements of qualifying entities that otherwise \\napply the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements \\nof adopted  IFRS. \\nThe financial year represents the 52 weeks to 25 February 2023 \\n(prior financial year 52 weeks to 26 February 2022). \\nAs permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the \\ndisclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to \\nbusiness combinations, financial instruments, capital management, \\npresentation of comparative information in respect of certain \\nassets, presentation of a cash flow statement, impairment of \\nassets, share-based payments and related party transactions. The \\nCompany has also taken advantage of the exemption in relation to \\ndisclosure of the possible impact of the application of a new IFRS \\nthat has been issued but is not yet effective. Where required, \\nequivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated  financial \\nstatements of Tesco PLC. \\nThe Parent Company financial statements are prepared on a going \\nconcern basis as set out in Note 1 of the consolidated Group financial \\nstatements of Tesco PLC. \\nThe Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under \\nsection 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and not presented an \\nincome statement or a statement of comprehensive income for  \\nthe Company alone. \\nA summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is set \\nout below. \\nInvestments in subsidiaries and joint ventures \\nInvestments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are stated at cost less, \\nwhere appropriate, provisions for impairment. The Company tests \\nthe investment balances for impairment annually or when there are \\nindicators of impairment.  \\nForeign currencies \\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional \\ncurrency at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. \\nAt each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are \\ndenominated in foreign currencies are retranslated to the functional \\ncurrency at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Share-based payments \\nThe fair value of employee share option plans is calculated at \\nthe grant date using the Black-Scholes model. The  resulting cost is \\ncharged to the Company income statement over  the vesting period. \\nThe value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual \\nlevels of vesting. Where the Company awards shares or options to \\nemployees of subsidiary entities, this is treated as a capital \\ncontribution. \\nOwn shares held \\nOwn shares represent the shares of Tesco PLC that are held by the \\nTesco International Employee Benefit Trust, or which are purchased \\nand held for cancellation as part of the share buyback programme. \\nThe Company adopts a  ‘look-through’ approach which, in substance, \\naccounts for the Trust as an extension of the Company. Shares \\npurchased for cancellation are included in own shares held until \\ncancellation, at which point they ar e transferred to retained earnings. \\nOwn shares held can include equity elements of forward contracts \\nwhere the Group has an obligation to purchase its own shares. \\nFinancial instruments \\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the \\nCompany balance sheet when the Company becomes party to \\nthe contractual provisions of the instrument. \\nReceivables \\nReceivables are recognised initially at fair value, and subsequently \\nat amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any \\nexpected credit losses. \\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments  \\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according \\nto the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. \\nAn equity instrument is any contract that gives a residual interest in \\nthe assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity \\ninstruments issued by the Company are recorded as the proceeds \\nreceived, net of di rect issue costs. \\nInterest-bearing borrowings \\nInterest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recognised at \\nfair value and net of attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to \\ninitial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised \\ncost with any differences between proceeds and redemption value \\nbeing recognised in the Company income statement over the period \\nof the borrowings on an effective interest basis.  \\nPayables \\nPayables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at \\namortised cost using the effective interest rate method. \\nDerivative financial instru ments and hedge accounting \\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its \\nexposure to foreign ex change and interest ra te risks arising from \\noperating, financing and investing activities. The Company does not \\nhold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. \\nDerivative financial instruments are recognised and stated at fair \\nvalue. Where derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, any \\ngains or losses on remeasurement are immediately recognised in \\nthe Company income statement. Where derivatives qualify for hedge \\naccounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the \\nnature of the hedge relationship and the item being hedged. In order \\nto qualify for hedge accounting, the Company is required to \\ndocument from inception, the relationship between the item \\nbeing hedged and the hedging instrument. \\nFinancial statements\\n193 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023', metadata={'source': 'pdf files/tesco.pdf', 'page': 194}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Notes to the Parent Company financial statements continued  \\n194 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023 Note 2 Accounting policies continued  \\nThe Company is also required to document and demonstrate an \\nassessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the \\nhedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective \\non an ongoing basis. This effectiveness testing is performed at each \\nreporting date to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective. \\nDerivative financial instruments wi th maturity dates of more than \\none year from the reporting date  are disclosed as non-current. \\nFair value hedging \\nDerivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges \\nwhen they hedge the Company’s exposure to changes in the fair \\nvalue of a recognised asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of \\nderivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are \\nrecorded in the Company income statement, together with any \\nchanges in the fair value of the hedged item that are attributable \\nto the hedged risk.  \\nIf the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, \\nthe adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item is \\namortised  to the Company income statement over the remaining  \\nperiod to  maturity. \\nCash flow hedging \\nDerivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges \\nwhen they hedge the Company’s exposure to variability in cash flows \\nthat are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a \\nrecognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecasted \\ntransaction. The effective element of any gain or loss from \\nremeasuring the derivative designated as the hedging instrument \\nis recognised directly in the Company statement of comprehensive \\nincome and accumulated in the hedging reserve. Any cost of \\nhedging, such as the change in fair value related to forward points \\nand currency basis adjustment is separately accumulated in the \\ncost  of hedging reserve. The ineffective element is recognised \\nimmediately in the Company income statement. \\nThe associated cumulative gain or loss is reclassified from other  \\ncomprehensive income and recognised in the Company income \\nstatement in the same period or periods during which the  hedged \\ntransaction affects the Company income statement. The \\nclassification of the effective portion when recognised in the \\nCompany income statement is the same as the classification of \\nthe hedged transaction. Any element of the remeasurement criteria \\nof the derivative instrument that does not meet the criteria for an \\neffective hedge is recognised immediately in the Company income \\nstatement within finance income or costs. \\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument \\nexpires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies \\nfor hedge accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gain or \\nloss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in \\nthe Company statement of changes in equity until the forecasted \\ntransaction occurs or the original hedged item affects the Company \\nincome statement. If a fore cast hedged transaction is  no longer \\nexpected to occur, the net cumulati ve gain or loss recognised in \\nthe Company statement of changes in equity is reclassified to the \\nCompany income statement. \\nPensions \\nThe Company participates in a Group defined benefit pension \\nscheme which is closed to future accrual. The net defined benefit \\ncost and deficit/surplus for the scheme are borne and recognised by \\nanother Group company, Tesco Stores Limited, as per the stated \\npolicy of the Group. The Company also participates in a defined \\ncontribution scheme open to all UK employees. Payments to this \\nscheme are recognised as an expense as they fall due. Taxation \\nThe tax expense included in the Company income statement \\nconsists of current and deferred tax. \\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for  \\nthe financial year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted  \\nby the balance sheet date. Tax expense is recognised in the \\nCompany income statement except to the extent that it relates \\nto items recognised in the Company statement of comprehensive \\nincome or directly in the Company statement of changes in equity, \\nin which case it is recognised in the Company statement of \\ncomprehensive income or directly in the Company statement \\nof changes in equity, respectively. \\nDeferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, \\nproviding for temporary differences between the carrying amounts \\nof assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the \\namounts used for taxation purposes. \\nDeferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply \\nin the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised,  based \\non the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by \\nthe balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the \\nCompany income statement, except when it relates  to items \\ncharged or credited directly to equity or other comprehensive \\nincome/(loss), in which case the deferred tax  is also recognised in \\nequity, or other comprehensive income/(loss), respectively. \\nJudgements and sources of estimation uncertainty \\nThe preparation of the Company financial statements requires \\nmanagement to make judgements, estimates and assumptions \\nin applying the Company’s accounting policies to determine the \\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.  \\nThe estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical \\nexperience and various other factors that are believed to be \\nreasonable under the circumstance s. Actual results may differ \\nfrom  these estimates.

       " Document(page_content='Glossary – Alternative performance measures \\n \\n207 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023 Other information Other information \\nIntroduction \\nIn the reporting of fina ncial information, the Directors have adopted va rious Alternative performance measures (APMs). \\nThese measures are not defined by International Financial Report ing Standards (IFRS) and therefore may not be directly comparab le with other \\ncompanies’ APMs, including those in the Group’s industry. APMs should be considered in addition to, and are not intended to be a substitute for, \\nor superior to, IFRS measures.  \\nPurpose \\nThe Directors believe that these APMs assist in providing additi onal useful information on the trends, performance and position  of the Group. \\nAPMs aid comparability between geographical units or provide meas ures that are widely used acro ss the industry. They also aid c omparability \\nbetween reporting periods; adjusting for certain costs or incomes that derive from events or transactions that fall within the normal activities \\nof the Group but which, by virtue of their size or nature, are adjusted, can provide a helpful alternative perspective on year-on- year trends, \\nperformance and position that aids comparability over time. \\nThe alternative view presented by these APMs is consistent with how management views the business, and how it is reported inter nally to the \\nBoard and Executive Committee for performa nce analysis, planning, reporting, decisi on-making and incentive-setting purposes. \\nFurther information on the Group’s adjusting items, which is a critical accounting judgement, can be found in Notes 1 and 4. \\nSome of the Group’s IFRS measures are transl ated at constant exchange rates. Constant exchange rates are the average actual per iodic \\nexchange rates for the previous financial period and are used to eliminate the effects of exchange rate fluctuations in assessi ng performance. \\nActual exchange rates are the average actual peri odic exchange rates for that financial period. \\nChanges to APMs \\nThe Adjusted diluted earnings per share (adjusted for share consol idation) APM was previously provided to aid year-on-year comp arability in the \\nevent of a share consolidation. The APM is no longer relevant for the 2022/23 financial year so has been removed.  \\nGroup APMs   \\nAPM Closest equivalent  \\nIFRS measure Adjustments to reconcile  \\nto IFRS measure  Definition and purpose \\nIncome statement     \\nRevenue measures     \\nSales Revenue – Fuel sales  – Excludes the impact of fuel sales made at petrol filling stations to \\ndemonstrate the Group’s performance in the retail and financial \\nservices businesses. It removes volatilities outside of the control \\nof management, associated with the movement in fuel prices.  \\n– This  is a key management incentive metric. \\n– This measure is also presented on a Retail and Tesco Bank basis. \\nGrowth in sales No direct equivalent  – Ratio N/A  – Growth in sales is a ratio that measures year-on-year movement \\nin Group sales for continuing operations for 52  weeks. It shows \\nthe annual rate of increase in the Group’s sales and is \\nconsidered a good indicator of how rapidly the  Group’s core \\nbusiness is growing. \\nLike-for-like (LFL) No direct equivalent – Ratio N/A  – Like-for-like is a measure of growth in Group online sales and \\nsales from stores that have been  open for at leas t a year (but \\nexcludes prior year sales of stor es closed during the year) at \\nconstant foreign exchange rates. It is a widely used indicator of a \\nretailer’s current trading performance and is important when \\ncomparing growth between retailers that have different profiles \\nof expansion, disposals and closures.  \\n  \\nOther information\\n207 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023', metadata={'source': 'pdf files/tesco.pdf', 'page': 208}),\n",

Net pension \\nfinance income/costs are impacted by corporate bond yields, \\nwhich can fluctuate significantly and are reset each year based \\non external market factors that are outside management’s \\ncontrol. Fair value remeasurements are impacted by changes to \\ncredit risk and various market indices, applying to financial \\ninstruments resulting from liability management exercises, \\nwhich can fluctuate significantly outside of management’s \\ncontrol. This measure helps to provide an alternative view of \\nyear-on-year trends in the Group’s finance costs. \\nAdjusted profit before tax  Profit before tax – Adjusting items(b)  – This measure is the summation of the impact of all adjusting \\nitems on profit before tax. Refer to the APM Purpose section of \\nthe Glossary and Note 1 for further information on adjusting \\nitems. \\nAdjusted operating margin  No direct equivalent – Ratio N/A  – Operating margin is calculated as adjusted operating profit \\ndivided by revenue. Progression in operating margin is an \\nimportant indicator of the Group’s operating efficiency. \\nAdjusted diluted earnings  \\nper share  Diluted earnings per share \\nfrom continuing operations – Adjusting items(b)  – This metric shows the adjusted profit after tax from continuing \\noperations attributable to owners of the parent divided by the \\nweighted average number of ordinary shares in  issue during the \\nfinancial period, adjusted for the effects of potentially dilutive \\nshare options.  \\nRetail EBITDA (earnings \\nbefore adjusting items, \\ninterest, tax, depreciation \\nand amortisation)  Retail operating profit from \\ncontinuing operations(a) – Adjusting items(b) \\n– Depreciation and \\namortisation \\n  – This measure is widely used by analysts, investors and other \\nusers of the accounts to evaluate comparable profitability of \\ncompanies, as it excludes the impact of differing capital \\nstructures and tax positions, variations in tangible asset \\nportfolios and differences in identification and recognition of \\nintangible assets. It is used to  derive the Net debt/EBITDA and \\nTotal indebtedness ratios, and Fixed charge cover APMs. \\nNet interest margin No direct equivalent – Ratio N/A  – Net interest margin is calculated by dividing Tesco Bank \\nannualised net interest income, less annualised lease interest \\nexpense, by average inte rest-bearing assets. \\n– It is a measure of the gross profitability of Tesco Bank’s lending \\noperations. \\nTax measures     \\nAdjusted effective tax rate Effective tax rate – Adjusting items(b)  – Adjusted effective tax rate is calculated as total income tax \\ncredit/(charge) excluding the tax impact of adjusting items, \\ndivided by adjusted profit before tax.

It is a measure of the Group’s \\nability to meet its payment obligations, showing how long it \\nwould take the Group to repay its current net debt if both net \\ndebt and EBITDA remained constant. It is widely used by analysts \\nand credit rati ng agencies. \\nTotal indebtedness  No direct equivalent – N/A  – Total indebtedness is Net debt plus the IAS 19 deficit in any \\npension schemes (net of associated deferred tax) to provide \\nan overall view of the Group’s obligations, including the long-\\nterm commitments to the Group’s pension schemes. Pension \\nsurpluses are not included. It is an important measure of the \\nlong-term obligations of the Group and is a measure widely \\nused by credit rating agencies.  \\nTotal indebtedness ratio No direct equivalent – Ratio N/A  – Total indebtedness ratio is calculated as Total indebtedness \\ndivided by the rolling 12-month Re tail EBITDA. It is a measure of \\nthe Group’s ability to meet its payment obligations and is widely \\nused by analysts and credit rating agencies. \\nFixed charge cover No direct equivalent – Ratio N/A  – Fixed charge cover is calculated as the rolling 12-month Retail \\nEBITDA divided by the sum of net finance costs (excluding net \\npension finance income/costs, finance charges payable on \\nlease liabilities, capitalised interest and fair value \\nremeasurements) and all lease liability payments from \\ncontinuing operations. It is a measure of the Group’s ability to \\nmeet its payment obligations and is widely used by analysts \\nand credit rating  agencies. \\nCapex Property, plant and \\nequipment, intangible \\nasset, and investment \\nproperty additions, \\nexcluding those from \\nbusiness combinations – Additions relating to \\nproperty buybacks \\n– Additions relating to \\ndecommissioning \\nprovisions and similar \\nitems  – Capex excludes additions arising from business combinations \\nand buybacks of properties (typically stores), as well as additions \\nrelating to decommissioning provisions and similar items. \\n– Property buybacks are variable in timing, with the number and \\nvalue of buybacks dependent on opportunities that arise within \\nany given financial ye ar. Excluding property  buybacks therefore \\ngives an alternative view of tren ds in capital ex penditure in the \\nGroup’s ongoing trading operations.  \\n– Additions relating to decommissioning provisions and similar \\nitems are adjusted because they do not result in near-term \\ncash outflows. \\nCash flow measures      \\nRetail free cash flow No direct equivalent – N/A  – Retail free cash flow includes continuing cash flows from \\noperating and investing activities for the Retail business, the \\nmarket purchase of shares net of proceeds from shares issued \\nin relation to share schemes and repayment of obligations \\nunder leases, excluding the effects of Tesco Bank’s cash flows. \\nThe following items are excluded: investing cash flows that \\nincrease/decrease items within Net debt; proceeds from the \\nsale of property, plant and equipment, investment property, \\nintangible assets and assets classified as held for sale; cash \\nutilised to buy back property; proceeds from the sale of \\nsubsidiaries; cash utilised in business acquisitions; cash used for \\ninvestment in joint ventures, associates and unlisted equity \\ninvestments; and adjusting cash items in operating cash \\nactivities.  \\n– By adjusting for these factors, which can have unpredictable \\ntimings or amounts, or can be driven by external events or non-\\noperational business decisions (such as acquisitions and \\ndisposals of properties as opportunities arise), the Directors \\nand management believe this provides a view of free cash flow \\ngenerated by the Group’s retail trading operations that is more \\npredictable and comparable over time, and reflects the cash \\navailable to shareholders.  \\n– This is a key manageme nt incentive metric. \\n(a) Operating profit is presented on the Group income statement. It is not defined per IFRS, however, is a generally accepted profi t measure. \\n(b) Refer to Note 1 and Note 4.  \\nOther information\\n209 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023', metadata={'source': 'pdf files/tesco.pdf', 'page': 210}),\n",
